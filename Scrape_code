1)there is ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUE WITH THE DISPLAY... its crisp, sharp and I found it to be much much better than OP7 pro. Netflix, Prime video all run crisply... you won’t miss a thing. True Tone works flawlessly...the display brightness is perfect. OP have not calibrated their screens properly.

518,5,Great product,Again back to apple iphone after a gap of 2-3 years. It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.

The battery back is great .
The LCD panel is not so sharp but the brightness level is very High .

The A13 Bionic chip is really a flagship processor and can beat any phone which even has 12 gb ram .
Camera module is very great and looks very stylish."

1. iPhone 11 is a pretty solid phone for the money you are paying.
2. All the bad reviews about the display is confusing. It’s not that bad.
3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display. Gets adequately bright and I could not find any pixelation.

541,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
542,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
543,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it. Would recommed only if you have the budget.

As for as the processing is concerned, it runs without any lag. You can play and do whatever you want without a glitch.

The battery runs for a day with medium and high workload.

The display is good and the speakers are working fine.

The earphones doesn't have any base and you can use it for calling mostly.

I purchased Apple iPhone 11. with an exchange of IPhone 7, the exchange did not go well, iPhone 7 had a small scratch out side screen which i could never identify till date, but the FLIPKART person could, so he reduced 50% from exchange rate. I decided not to trade in, but paid money.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."

570,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."
571,5,Super!,"This is my first ever iPhone.
And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the bri..."

1. iPhone 11 is a pretty solid phone for the money you are paying.
2. All the bad reviews about the display is confusing. It’s not that bad.
3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display. Gets adequately bright and I could not find any pixelation.

Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
842,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
843,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."

924,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
925,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
926,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use
3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"
927,5,Highly recommended,"Thanx flipkart for value super sale for short time period of 1hour😁, flipkart might need to work on faster delivery
Iphone 12 which i got in best price on flipkart
1. Camera performance - superb
2. Display - superb
3. Interface - Amazing"
928,4,Very Good,"Top notch performance, get it if you have budget and want a reliable Smartphone for long term.

Still apple need some improvement in display like high refresh rate, smaller notch or full screen display may be."
929,5,Simply awesome,"I got my I phone 12 in just 2 days of order, Thanks flipkart for delivering it faster.

Pros:
Super faster than previous version
Display is amazing
Speaker is absolutely perfect.
It gives very classic premium looks.

Cons:
Charger & earphones are not coming in the box for the you need to spend 4k extra.
Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."
930,5,Excellent,"It's my first iphone ever n i brought it with all my earned money✌✌
The best is yet to come n i am really happy with the product was delivered on time by flipkart
Overall it's light weighted, awesome camera quality n i love the purple color 😍🥰 so it's a dream come to true finally have a iphone ✌💯"
931,5,Terrific,"Product is very fantastic i am just love it.
Display is awesome.
Performance like buttery smooth. Iam android user before 6year but never experience like this performance.
You can definitely go for this. Due to late delivery i give only three star."
932,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
933,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
934,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
935,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
936,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
937,5,Best in the market!,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."
938,4,Worth the money,"Such a great phone with great features…excellent camera and display….decent battery life .. value for money phone …beast like processor ❤️❤️❤️
You can go for this without any hesitation … if u want to use a phone for long term simply go for this (128 gb) …"

940,5,Must buy!,"Top class performance and battery backup too. Charges quickly if u are using a 20w charger. Night mode is good , HDR mode works flawlessly. VFM phone."
941,5,Highly recommended,"Got iPhone 12 128 gb version for just 52k during October 2021 big billion sale.. This would be the cheapest price in 2021 to get this brand new iPhone in India..
Performance of phone and its brilliant cameras are just mind blowing.. Really love this phone a-lot.. Battery backup could have been better.. but still it's manageable.. Thank you Flipkart for providing this phone for such a affordable price"
942,5,Great product,"Stunning look, very premium, awesome camera, I have a moderate use so I get 2 days battery life in single charge, overall very happy with the purchase and last but not the least Fast delivery by Flipkart."
943,5,Another Perfect Apple product to Hold,"Using iPhone since 5S onwards, it's never been a single thought to switch any other mobiles other than Apple. And iPhone 12 is an another wonderful device from Apple, finally upgraded from iPhone 7 --> iPhone 12 256GB. So happy with the product and comfort.

Still my old iPhone 7 is working like new, that is what I love about apple products. Highly recommend.

Thanks for quick delivery."
944,5,Wonderful,Got a genuine product. Checked the serial number online as well and it all matched. Works like a charm. Fast as ever. Worth the money
945,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thing is I need to thank the seller for giving the original iPhone 12 for such a great pice. Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.

Now coming to the packing ,it was packed well and no damage was there. My old Samsung phone was exchanged for a good price and was also picked up by them.

947,5,Terrific purchase,"Writing this review after 50 days of ‘heavy’ use.

• The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.

• Battery performance is also good. While playing heavy games continuously it gives a backup of around 4hrs and around 3-1/2 hrs with screen recording. If u are not playing heavy games then the battery will last all day long and there will be still left around 20%..."
948,4,Delightful,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s 🍎, didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android."
949,5,Just wow!,Best mobile phone ever…..just go for it…..excellent battery life….no issue in battery….display is mind blowing….sound is like jhakkas….everything is perfect…i will mention one time more very nice battery backup…whole day n more also…if u use wisely your phone with proper settings….worth the value…and thank u Flipkart for fast delivery.

2. Good Looking Ceramic coated iPhone 12.
3. Performance rocket.
4. Camera awesome with added apps for photo n video. Seamlessly great"
952,5,Awesome,"An absolute charm to have this phone in your hands. Flipkart delivered in the next day in the BBD sale. Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
953,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."
954,5,Best in the market!,"Perfect iPhone . Glad that I Pick iPhone 12 instead of iPhone 11 , Prices are bit high but Features are completely fill that Price Gap . I love that Device . Happy User 😁"
955,5,Brilliant,"Save few bucks and buy this and avoid 13. Used this for a year and great compact beast if you got money to waste else restrict yourself for under 30k androids.
Not having great of everything but still best as it got everything you need in top notch phone."
956,5,Super!,Appreciated with product!!!!!! It's amazing🤩 when I ordered there was so many doubt related products quality and refurbished Or duplicate... But when it was reached its amazing experience. Phone was fully packed as it bought from showroom...... And same with warranty... Warranty is in accurately activated by system... Very good product
957,5,Terrific purchase,"Using apple after 3 years last I was using 6plus and after that S8 iOS is good if you are in this apple ecosystem otherwise I will ask everyone to stick to android
Camera is really good on this one
Speaker quality is amazing
Performance top notch
Battery life is fantastic it will last full day in heavy uses"
958,5,Must buy!,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.
959,5,Worth every penny,Firstly I would like to thanks Flipkart for one day delivery with secure & safe. Its realy awesome phone. I loved it. This is my first IPhone which I have swep from android to ios. White colour provide premium look. Tea Cup Pic is from IPhone 12
960,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.
- Square-shaped design co..."
961,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."
962,5,Super!,"Awesome product…
Camera: it’s superb.
Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use.
Display and design : perfect. iPhone 12 is looking so premium and best till date.
Performance: perfect and very smooth and premium.
Colour: i prefer Green because it looks more light green and different than others and ofcourse it gives premium look… 2nd option can be white.
Flipkart order : firstly I hesitated to buy from flipkart as it is of bug amount but I ordered and got my phone one day ..."
963,5,Perfect product!,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand. Each and every specification of the phone is worth the money. So just go ahead and purchase it without any second thought. I pre-ordered it and received the product on time. Thanks Flipkart for prompt service.

966,5,Awesome,"I recently upgraded to the iPhone 12 and I have no regrets. The phone is very sleek, streamlined and svelte looking, especially in the red color, which I prefer.
The phone works flawlessly, with great audio and a decent speaker, for voice or music. The text feature, likewise, is extremely easy to use and intuitive.

My suggestion is ..if you can afford it....you may go if you are a lover of quality over quantity..
Battery is okay...neither like it cant even run few hours nor like it will run till days...in between...you can take it with a little over mild usage....for 6 to 7 hours....."
969,3,Nice,"An apple fan, I find iPhone 12 light, easier to use than iPhone 11 as is compact in size and weight, display is a little better than iPhone 11, speed is also better and satisfactory.

Also the price strategy of apple for its products in india is positioned much higher than the developed countries while it should have been the other way round as the capacity to pay of people of developing nations like india is much lower th..."
970,5,Fabulous!,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones. Would definitely recommend to both iOS and android users. Good enough cameras, nice display with slim and “equal” bezels, overall a really great experience"
971,4,Good quality product,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex
Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.

2. Though the device houses the fastest chip across the globe (at the time of release), it still take couple of seco..."
972,5,Just wow!,"This is my first iPhone after being an android guy for last 10yr. Main reason for the switch was, having an Macbook and airpod already. So wanted to experience synergy between apple products in its ecosystem. Here is my 2 week review
Pros
1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable
2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so di..."
973,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
974,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."
975,5,Highly recommended,What a phone ! Its a beast in terms of performance and great battery life. Love the red colour. Got for a great price ! My first apple phone !

977,5,Terrific purchase,"As always awesome product by Apple and Nice timely and safe delivery by Flipkart.
First confused about colour but as compared with others Red does look Royal"
978,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
979,5,Classy product,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..💭♥️

981,4,Pretty good,"Delivery is super fast, after using it for 2 weeks, camera quality is superb, very smooth UI, compact and very light weight. 1st week everything was good, but after that auto rotate feature stopped working and eSim calls disconnecting frequently, contacted apple support but issues not yet resolved."
982,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Finally got the most awaited iPhone 12 with favourite white. With this purchase I have now a complete Apple products family range includes MacBook IPad and now iPhone 12. Very easy to initiate after denoting the iPhone as I had migrated all the data quickly with signing in.
Well it was a great deal with Flipkart, off course I got the the phone in two days after placing an order.
It’s been a few weeks now using iPhone, it’s different experience altogether.
Thank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics."
983,5,Excellent,"Superb phone from apple. Buttery smooth and blazingly fast. Just missing telephoto camera at this price. This could be provided by Apple. Also charger is not coming along. At this price customer expects that.

986,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This is my 1st Apple product and I must say it's a beast of a device 🔥

987,4,Nice product,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.

1. iPhone 11 is a pretty solid phone for the money you are paying.
2. All the bad reviews about the display is confusing. It’s not that bad.
3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display. Gets adequately bright and I could not find any pixelation.

1241,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
1242,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
1243,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."

1270,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

Still apple need some improvement in display like high refresh rate, smaller notch or full screen display may be."
1329,5,Simply awesome,"I got my I phone 12 in just 2 days of order, Thanks flipkart for delivering it faster.

Pros:
Super faster than previous version
Display is amazing
Speaker is absolutely perfect.
It gives very classic premium looks.

Cons:
Charger & earphones are not coming in the box for the you need to spend 4k extra.
Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."
1330,5,Excellent,"It's my first iphone ever n i brought it with all my earned money✌✌
The best is yet to come n i am really happy with the product was delivered on time by flipkart

Display is awesome.
Performance like buttery smooth. Iam android user before 6year but never experience like this performance.
You can definitely go for this. Due to late delivery i give only three star."
1332,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
1333,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
1334,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
1335,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
1336,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
1337,5,Best in the market!,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."

1343,5,Another Perfect Apple product to Hold,"Using iPhone since 5S onwards, it's never been a single thought to switch any other mobiles other than Apple. And iPhone 12 is an another wonderful device from Apple, finally upgraded from iPhone 7 --> iPhone 12 256GB. So happy with the product and comfort.

Still my old iPhone 7 is working like new, that is what I love about apple products. Highly recommend.

Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.

• The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.

1348,4,Delightful,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s 🍎, didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android."

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
1353,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."

1358,5,Must buy!,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.

1360,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.
- Square-shaped design co..."
1361,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."
1362,5,Super!,"Awesome product…
Camera: it’s superb.
Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use.

1363,5,Perfect product!,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand.

1370,5,Fabulous!,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones.

1371,4,Good quality product,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex
Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.

1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable

1373,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
1374,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

First confused about colour but as compared with others Red does look Royal"
1378,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
1379,5,Classy product,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..💭♥️

Thank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics."

1387,4,Nice product,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.

Video call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins.
Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins.

Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I’m using. I’m not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn’t look nice to me."

1418,5,Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days.

I purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :

1. Device looks small but the way it works is truly amazing.

However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok.

Love the glass body with matte finish in the lens area on the back. Lovely colours to choose from. Best battery in an iPhone till date, enough to last more than a day in normal usage. I tested my iPhone 11 battery and lasted for than 24 hours after full charge still with 30% battery charge left. Watched movies for some time. Normal usage on calls, browsing, musi..."
1714,5,Terrific purchase,"The built quality is not very premium.
The battery back is great .
The LCD panel is not so sharp but the brightness level is very High .
Camera is super duper awesome.
The red colour which people think is bright is actually very soothing and excellent colour to choose from .
The A13 Bionic chip is really a flagship processor and can beat any phone which even has 12 gb ram .
Camera module is very great and looks very stylish."
1715,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android.

1720,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
1721,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
1722,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it. Would recommed only if you have the budget.

The battery runs for a day with medium and high workload.

The display is good and the speakers are working fine.

The earphones doesn't have any base and you can use it for calling mostly.

The charging time is approximately for 90 minutes for full charging..."

I purchased Apple iPhone 11. with an exchange of IPhone 7, the exchange did not go well, iPhone 7 had a small scratch out side screen which i could never identify till date, but the FLIPKART person could, so he reduced 50% from exchange rate. I decided not to trade in, but paid money.

1747,1,Worthless,"Phone is awesome no doubt. But Camera & Display is not great. Performance is mind blowing.
But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."
1748,5,Super!,"Did an upgrade from 6s plus to iphone 11.
Ao far the experience is well and good. Felt smoother than 6s plus. The camera quality is superb. Battery backup is descent. Not a heavy user, and gets power more than a day. Go for it if you need an alrounder iphone in a competitve price."
1749,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."
1750,5,Super!,"This is my first ever iPhone.
And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.
Comparing will only make you confused.

1755,5,Worth every penny,"Here is the thing

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That’s why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

1758,5,Wonderful,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly..."

Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

1809,5,Excellent,"It's my first iphone ever n i brought it with all my earned money✌✌
The best is yet to come n i am really happy with the product was delivered on time by flipkart

Display is awesome.
Performance like buttery smooth. Iam android user before 6year but never experience like this performance.
You can definitely go for this. Due to late delivery i give only three star."
1811,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
1812,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
1813,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
1814,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
1815,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
1816,5,Best in the market!,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."

1822,5,Another Perfect Apple product to Hold,"Using iPhone since 5S onwards, it's never been a single thought to switch any other mobiles other than Apple. And iPhone 12 is an another wonderful device from Apple, finally upgraded from iPhone 7 --> iPhone 12 256GB. So happy with the product and comfort.

Still my old iPhone 7 is working like new, that is what I love about apple products. Highly recommend.

Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.

• The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.

1827,4,Delightful,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s 🍎, didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging.. Camera is good but not best out there and also keep in mind there is no file manager for data management and data sharing is not as easy as android."

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
1832,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."

1837,5,Must buy!,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.

1839,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.
- Square-shaped design co..."
1840,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."
1841,5,Super!,"Awesome product…
Camera: it’s superb.
Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use.

1842,5,Perfect product!,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand.

1849,5,Fabulous!,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones.

1850,4,Good quality product,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex
Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.

1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable

1852,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
1853,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

First confused about colour but as compared with others Red does look Royal"
1857,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
1858,5,Classy product,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..💭♥️

Thank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics."

1866,4,Nice product,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.

Awesome Camera, amazing Performance thanks to A13 Bionic.

Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.

1897,5,Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.

Updating this review after a further 2 weeks of use.

Initially, there was some heating on the phone, but on further use that problem has disappeared. Got to explore the camera a bit more and found it to be very good, the stability on the video is also good.

1903,4,Go for it without any hesitation.,"Honest advice : Don't watch any tech reviewer's videos before buying this beast.

I purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :

1. Device looks small but the way it works is truly amazing.
2. if you are switching from ~6"" screen , it is going to be troublesome for a while.

1904,4,Pretty good,"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

1908,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn’t matter so much. Display is ok.

1909,5,Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace.

2. Kickass A13 bionic chip , one of the best energy efficient apple processor produced till date.

Downside:
1. Battery drain very fast.(googled and made it battery efficient) now it last atleast 1.5 day with moderate usage.

Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily.

P.S.- it's not that small."
1939,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.

2229,5,Worth every penny,"It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use , internet connected always with 4g
Can’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to charge
Camera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome.

2230,5,Wonderful,This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.
2231,4,Nice product,"Awesome Phone. Slightly high price but worth. Better than iPhone XR.
Camera is superb and wide angle camera is very clear.

2237,5,Great product,Again back to apple iphone after a gap of 2-3 years. It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.

The battery back is great .
The LCD panel is not so sharp but the brightness level is very High .

The red colour which people think is bright is actually very soothing and excellent colour to choose from .
The A13 Bionic chip is really a flagship processor and can beat any phone which even has 12 gb ram .
Camera module is very great and looks very stylish."

2260,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
2261,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
2262,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it. Would recommed only if you have the budget.

The battery runs for a day with medium and high workload.

The display is good and the speakers are working fine.

The earphones doesn't have any base and you can use it for calling mostly.

I purchased Apple iPhone 11. with an exchange of IPhone 7, the exchange did not go well, iPhone 7 had a small scratch out side screen which i could never identify till date, but the FLIPKART person could, so he reduced 50% from exchange rate. I decided not to trade in, but paid money.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."

2289,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."

And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊

Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂

2334,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating. I don’t know if the problem is only with my device or its general,..."

Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch. Icing on the cake apple car play is much more usable than android auto😬😬"
2336,5,Best in the market!,"So far so good. It’s my dream to own an iPhone for over a decade. Finally came true with iPhone 12. Previously owned Samsung S9 plus so competing with android i will say my likes and dislikes.

Battery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day.
Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
2340,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

2341,5,Great product,"First time in my life I'm trying iphone, I'm an android Samsung note user. There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

2343,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
2344,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
2345,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use
3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

Pros:
Super faster than previous version
Display is amazing
Speaker is absolutely perfect.
It gives very classic premium looks.

Cons:
Charger & earphones are not coming in the box for the you need to spend 4k extra.
Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."

2351,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
2352,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
2353,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
2354,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
2355,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
2356,5,Best in the market!,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."

And iPhone 12 is an another wonderful device from Apple, finally upgraded from iPhone 7 --> iPhone 12 256GB. So happy with the product and comfort.

Still my old iPhone 7 is working like new, that is what I love about apple products. Highly recommend.

Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.

• The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.

2367,4,Delightful,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s 🍎, didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging..

2371,5,Awesome,"An absolute charm to have this phone in your hands. Flipkart delivered in the next day in the BBD sale. Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
2372,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."

2377,5,Must buy!,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.

2379,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.
- Square-shaped design co..."
2380,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

2392,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
2393,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

2397,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
2398,5,Classy product,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..💭♥️

So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11."
2494,5,Perfecto !,"1 Week after using the phone I am Simply Loving it!
I did a lot of research and was confused in Iphone XR, SE 2020 and One plus 8

If you are Ok with older design/big bezels or looking for GREAT Camera in budget phone or moving from Android to IOS, this phone is best for you.
Camera(Portrait in selfie mode), Build quality, A13 Bionic Chip, Compact design, latest OS(software support for at least 4 years) is simply Bang On!

Downs :
Night mode Camera quality is not good.
Battery is not the best..."
2495,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.
If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."
2496,4,Good quality product,"First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It’s been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions.
Pros:
Fits in the budget.
Handy device.
Camera and display are awesome.
Good network connectivity.
Latest iOS update.
Great build quality ( its glass back so be carefull )
Performance is great.
Can handle almost everything.
And yes it’s an iPhone!

2497,5,Simply awesome,"Breathtaking. Smooth Performance. Amazing Camera and video performance. Dual Sim. Smooth Networks. Ideal for first time Android users, who are doing the switch. Battery Backup is decent. Will last for a day, for a moderate user. Buy it for the A13 Bionic. You won't regret."
2498,4,Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
2499,4,Really Nice,"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11."
2500,5,Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel. Please remember each and every consumer who buys this phone is buying Primarily for its compact size. The dimensions are amazing, which overrides any other shortfall of the device such as battery, Screen s..."
2501,5,Super!,"First of all thank u apple for making such good phone.
Guys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.
Camera is too good in light, I mean best, but don’t expect great pics in night.
Battery life is good according to size and display of phone, keep one fast charger with u and forget about battery issue because there is no issue with battery if u are not a hardcore gamer. It gives u full day with battery with moderate use. Charging in 30 minutes with 12 watt charger is 50 to 60%. I guess v..."
2502,5,Classy product,It is a very good device. You will feel how premium is it whenever you hold in your hand. It is very nice to hold. And size is just perfect! Above all it has the best camera. See the attached picture which I clicked in the evening.You should go for the red one!
2503,5,Terrific,"I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :
*This phone has not so big display and only supports upto 720p videos on YouTube, so if you watch YouTube all day and love big screens it’s not th..."

2507,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using iphones for a long time
iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s ,
So when time came to change, I had to chose between iphone11 and iphone SE2020.

Now I chose SE2020 and I am happy with the purchase.

Main reason for choosing SE2020 was the latest CPU and fingerprint scanner.
I am not comfortable with Face ID .

The primary rear camera has a 13-megapixel resolution, compared to 12 megapixels on its two siblings. That might seem like a slight improvement, but the aperture is down from f/1.8 to f/2.2 which means it can't take in as much light per exposure.

2821,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

2848,5,Wonderful,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly..."

This phone is really amazing. I ordered it for my wife and we click photos on this thing which are better than dslr.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
2890,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

2901,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
2902,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
2903,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
2904,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
2905,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

2939,5,Fabulous!,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones.

2940,4,Good quality product,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex
Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.

Pros
1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable
2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so di..."
2942,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
2943,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

2947,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products.

The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

3023,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."
3024,5,Brilliant,"For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean top notch performance ......
FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY
This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch

3026,4,Wonderful,"Well, the phone is small and looks nice. It's not for people who loves bigger ones. It's basically for those people who don't use their phones for everything.
It's fast.
design is cool, sleek and beautiful. You will need a back cover for sure if you want to keep up it's beauty. P:)
battery life - not so good.
voice clarity is fine.

3027,5,Wonderful,"Like It, Apple SE very nice and handy mobile, we can use it by single hand, like it too much if you are going single handy mobile you can go with Apple SE 2020 without any hesitation."
3028,5,Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
3029,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

Pros:
1. Blazing fast processor. Runs everything thrown at it without a stutter.

3045,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.

So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
3391,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
3392,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
3473,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
3474,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
3475,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
3476,5,Best in the market!,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."

• The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
3492,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."

3497,5,Must buy!,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.

3499,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.

3500,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

Camera: it’s superb.
Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use.

Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.

3512,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
3513,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

3517,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.

Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.

3557,5,Best in this budget,"This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set, I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.

3558,5,Terrific,"This is my first iPhone. And after using it for 6 continuous days the difference between my previous Sony XZS Android and this iPhone is easily noticeable.

Updating this review after a further 2 weeks of use.

Initially, there was some heating on the phone, but on further use that problem has disappeared. Got to explore the camera a bit more and found it to be very good, the stability on the video is also good.

3563,4,Go for it without any hesitation.,"Honest advice : Don't watch any tech reviewer's videos before buying this beast.

I purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :

1. Device looks small but the way it works is truly amazing.
2. if you are switching from ~6"" screen , it is going to be troublesome for a while.
3. 1821 mah battery . 0 to 100% charging time is around 130 minutes. Fast charging/wireless charging is supported but fast charger is not included in box.

3564,4,Pretty good,"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

3568,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok.

3583,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

P.S.- it's not that small."
3589,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.

3. I switched from a Oneplus 7t. I have no complaints about the display quality of iPhone. Yes, it’s not OLED, so, we are missing on the deep blacks. But that’s it. It is a very colour accurate display. Gets adequately bright and I could not find any pixelation.

3930,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
3931,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
3932,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."

3959,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch.

Battery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day.
Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
4010,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

3. Haven’t used camera much but pretty sure it’s splendid too.

4013,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
4014,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
4015,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use
3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

Pros:
Super faster than previous version
Display is amazing
Speaker is absolutely perfect.
It gives very classic premium looks.

Cons:
Charger & earphones are not coming in the box for the you need to spend 4k extra.
Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."

4021,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
4022,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
4023,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
4024,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
4025,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
4042,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."

4049,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.

4050,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
4063,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.

The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.

The worst thing is it’s battery. Doesn’t last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."

Sexy as it looks, just a perfect masterpiece."

This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones."
4099,4,Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness in

However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
4501,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.

Heavy usage . If you’re looking for a value for money device , I don’t see any other phone in the price range which can match the iPhone 11 .

The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
4580,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone.

Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
4585,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."

4591,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
4592,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
4593,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
4594,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
4595,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."

And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
4612,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

4620,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
4633,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

4637,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products.

The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.

4646,4,Nice product,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

Pros:
1. Blazing fast processor. Runs everything thrown at it without a stutter.

4735,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.
If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."

5079,5,Wonderful,Super and marvellous phone look very cute and nice sound. I love this phone i think white is good colur.Excellent camer 5*😍😘♥️♥️
5080,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
5081,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
5082,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it. Would recommed only if you have the budget.
5083,4,Pretty good,"I was using Iphone 6s and also Oneplus 6t. Both mobiles were perfectly alright in Photos, gaming, and smooth interface . My 6s mobile getting battery issue. thought upgrade to 11.

As for as the processing is concerned, it runs without any lag. You can play and do whatever you want without a glitch.

The battery runs for a day with medium and high workload.

The display is good and the speakers are working fine.

The earphones doesn't have any base and you can use it for calling mostly.

The charging time is approximately for 90 minutes for full charging..."

I purchased Apple iPhone 11. with an exchange of IPhone 7, the exchange did not go well, iPhone 7 had a small scratch out side screen which i could never identify till date, but the FLIPKART person could, so he reduced 50% from exchange rate. I decided not to trade in, but paid money.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."
5108,5,Super!,"Did an upgrade from 6s plus to iphone 11.
Ao far the experience is well and good. Felt smoother than 6s plus. The camera quality is superb. Battery backup is descent. Not a heavy user, and gets power more than a day. Go for it if you need an alrounder iphone in a competitve price."
5109,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."
5110,5,Super!,"This is my first ever iPhone.
And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.
Comparing will only make you confused.

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly..."

A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
5173,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
5174,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
5175,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
5192,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

5200,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
5213,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."
5255,5,Awesome,"I jumped from old SE to the new SE.the screen to body sized ratio is perfect for usage for a medium size palm.
The highlight of this product is it’s elegance and sleek design. Looks so good in white colour.

5258,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn’t matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one a..."
5259,5,Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace. The only small minus point is battery. A but as i am a moderate user its perfectly fine for me. Great product as usual from apple.🙌🏻
5260,4,Value-for-money,"USP:
1. Compact mobile which i always wanted in iPhone models
2. Kickass A13 bionic chip , one of the best energy efficient apple processor produced till date.
3. Camera is awesome to take pics (only day time) 4K videos 30/60 fps.

Downside:
1. Battery drain very fast.(googled and made it battery efficient) now it last atleast 1.5 day with moderate usage.

Note: i would not advice this compact super mobile for people who are always glued to social media and YouTube.

This is for someone who w..."

5267,5,Best in the market!,"It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it, the camera is a beast, the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use, if ur a heavy user you'd need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get rlly good gameplay, worth the money, btw if ur coming for a larger screen, you might feel it's a lil too small but honestly it's not rlly that small, so buy it, it's perfect."

5273,4,Nice product,"It’s a beast in performance, only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand.

5283,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

5288,5,Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
5289,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

5412,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
5438,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

cons:

5448,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
5449,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left.

5451,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.

So this is best for gaming."
5454,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .

5462,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."

Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
5464,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."

5470,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.

Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
5751,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
5752,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."

5779,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

5824,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating. I don’t know if the problem is only with my device or its general,..."

Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch. Icing on the cake apple car play is much more usable than android auto😬😬"
5826,5,Best in the market!,"So far so good. It’s my dream to own an iPhone for over a decade. Finally came true with iPhone 12. Previously owned Samsung S9 plus so competing with android i will say my likes and dislikes.

Battery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day.
Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
5830,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

3. Haven’t used camera much but pretty sure it’s splendid too.

5833,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
5834,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
5835,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use
3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

Pros:
Super faster than previous version
Display is amazing
Speaker is absolutely perfect.
It gives very classic premium looks.

Cons:
Charger & earphones are not coming in the box for the you need to spend 4k extra.
Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."

5841,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
5842,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
5843,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
5844,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
5845,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
5846,5,Best in the market!,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."

• The performance is just flawless. I played BGMI usually 6-7 hrs daily for 25-30 days (both classics and tournaments) with screen recording and never got even a single framedrop.

5857,4,Delightful,"Undoubtedly awesome in performance, after all it’s 🍎, didn’t like battary backup though, with heavy usage can’t survive for a day, need to juice up in evening, another disadvantage is No fast charging..

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
5862,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."

5867,5,Must buy!,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.

5869,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.

5870,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

5872,5,Perfect product!,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand.

5882,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
5883,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

5887,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
5888,5,Classy product,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..💭♥️

The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.

The worst thing is it’s battery. Doesn’t last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."

This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones."
5919,4,Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.
2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.

5986,4,Good quality product,"First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It’s been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions.
Pros:
Fits in the budget.
Handy device.
Camera and display are awesome.
Good network connectivity.
Latest iOS update.
Great build quality ( its glass back so be carefull )
Performance is great.
Can handle almost everything.
And yes it’s an iPhone!

5987,5,Simply awesome,"Breathtaking. Smooth Performance. Amazing Camera and video performance. Dual Sim. Smooth Networks. Ideal for first time Android users, who are doing the switch. Battery Backup is decent. Will last for a day, for a moderate user. Buy it for the A13 Bionic. You won't regret."
5988,4,Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
5989,4,Really Nice,"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11."
5990,5,Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel. Please remember each and every consumer who buys this phone is buying Primarily for its compact size. The dimensions are amazing, which overrides any other shortfall of the device such as battery, Screen s..."
5991,5,Super!,"First of all thank u apple for making such good phone.
Guys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.
Camera is too good in light, I mean best, but don’t expect great pics in night.
Battery life is good according to size and display of phone, keep one fast charger with u and forget about battery issue because there is no issue with battery if u are not a hardcore gamer. It gives u full day with battery with moderate use. Charging in 30 minutes with 12 watt charger is 50 to 60%. I guess v..."
5992,5,Classy product,It is a very good device. You will feel how premium is it whenever you hold in your hand. It is very nice to hold. And size is just perfect! Above all it has the best camera. See the attached picture which I clicked in the evening.You should go for the red one!
5993,5,Terrific,"I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :
*This phone has not so big display and only supports upto 720p videos on YouTube, so if you watch YouTube all day and love big screens it’s not th..."

5996,5,Terrific purchase,"Fantastic phone, in a beautiful form factor, handy, ergonomic and power packed device.

This is the perfect phone for no non sense every day users, who would like to make calls,browse the internet, use mail clients and do social networking."
5997,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using iphones for a long time
iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s ,
So when time came to change, I had to chose between iphone11 and iphone SE2020.

Now I chose SE2020 and I am happy with the purchase.

Main reason for choosing SE2020 was the latest CPU and fingerprint scanner.
I am not comfortable with Face ID .

The Phone Size seems small but for someone used to iphone 6S, it seems the same !!

Normal battery, nice camera but don’t go for se if you’re just going for camera cuz even if it performs well, you’ll see how it fares in low light and the front camera oh the front camera. It’s not bad but it’s not good either. Or is it just me? Cuz I see mine a lil bit grainy and not like super clear. I know it’s just 7mp but well. I compared it with an 11 and a 12.

6092,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."

Good product."
6118,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

6136,5,Perfect product!,best earphones I have ever buy in life soft and clear sound bass is little bit low but it doesn't effect the sound just fabulous
6137,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First of the design is so nice, the texture of the colour is amazing.. Now came to sound quality..I didn't expect it will be this good!! The bass is perfect for ears .. I really feel enjoyed whenever i listen any songs through this headset.. really satisfied for this product... recommend everyone to buy it and enjoy..Thank you."
6138,5,Must buy!,Excellent product it has amazing sound and amazing bass It is better that jbl and boat and value for money
6139,4,Nice product,"Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.
Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.
Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain."
6140,5,Best in the market!,"realme buds 2 is the best earphones. Perfect for people who like the bass. Sound quality is awesome. Audio is balanced and every instrument is clearly heard.At the price of 500 rupees, it cannot be better than this."
6141,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
6142,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
6143,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
6144,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
6145,5,Terrific purchase,"It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.
One more thing.... The cable organizer helps a lot while keeping the earphone safe and organized while travelling and keeping in jeans pocket.

Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

6149,4,Wonderful,"This earphone is truly worth it's price i.e. 500. Got it 2 days ago and using it since then. Sound quality is awsm and bass too. The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
6150,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

This is my second pair of these earp..."
6151,4,Value-for-money,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

Feel like sennheiser quality in low price."
6172,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

Realme released Buds 2 Neo which is 100 cheaper than this but go for Buds 2 instead of Neo and Buds 2 has more premium and sturdy cable.

6190,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
6191,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."
6192,1,Absolute rubbish! VERY BAD for CALLING,"If you buying this earphone for CALLING don't buy this. I received earphone and i try this. For calling it creating extra distortion in voice.

Every single minute detailed sound you can listen on this earphone and for playing PUBG.
6195,4,Delightful,"Compared it with Sennheiser cx180. Bass is smooth in this set but Sennheiser has high treble with boom bass.

Pros:
Sweat proof
Tangle free wire

Cons:
Moderate build quality, colour peeling off from various parts in one month of usage.

Switch controls not so good. Overall quality could be much better as compared to other products from boat in this price range"

6210,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes .

6239,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
6240,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
6241,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
6242,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
6243,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
6244,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs. Bass is good not that great but yeah it's ok for me. By the way i am not a bass lover. This headphone really justifies the price. Trust me it's a very good headphone. You r going to love it.
6245,4,Good quality product,"Amazing literally awesome wire quality too good and sound and bass also epic you can surely use it for gaming also and it fits quite better in ears and no pain in my ears after wearing it for 3-4 hours
Bass is superb 😍"

6248,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It's one of the best earphone at this price range i recommend to go with this if u wanta pure sound quality and bass quality.
Comfort is also gud but the rubber kind of thing hurts ear a bit not much but only when u are lying or sleeping.
Must buy earphones boat is one of the best company after JBL"
6249,5,Wonderful,Awesome earphone. Small & stylish. Nice sound with music change and volume controls. Good product at this price range. Glad I ordered before the lockdown.
6250,4,Very Good,"This earphones are really awesome. Above average sound quality, great bass, fits in out ear perfectly, doesn't come out of your ear even while doing workouts and running.

Overall beast performer in this this price segment... Go for it without any doubt 😘😘😘"
6264,4,Worth the money,Good product for the price range not comparable to semheiser or JBL 700range earphone but at this budget it's good fit in ears and comfortable to use ... Hope it last long wire looks thin and bass is good but I wanted it for movie for movies it's good but this is made for bass music and again it's perfect fit in ears
6265,5,Perfect product!,"Writing this review post 1 month of usage.

Sound quality is good, Bass is also good. Worth the money. The only demerit is the metal plug, sometimes it gets tough to unplug it due to slippery texture. Rest all good. I would recommend to buy this without any hesitation."
6266,4,Worth the money,It was very smooth and clear bass and it is very stylish look.I like it .superr
6267,5,Highly recommended,It is a nice product but comparing this with basshead 100. In my opinion basshead 100 is better than fitting in ear easily. Not ideal product for using it normally to watch movies. For sports activity it is great
6268,5,Awesome,"This product bass is so boomy & the vocals and trubals are so clear. Boat 242 build quality is so good, soft and tangle free cable. Ear hook is so soft and comfortable,i essly use this product 3to4 hour continuance. Over all this product is so good,comfertable and one more think this is very good for gameplay or gaming i essly found my enemies foot step. Only Issue i have in this product is after 5 months the cable cover turn in yollowes. Thank you."
6269,4,Good quality product,"Sound quality is good for the price. I'm a music producer so I know a little bit about sound. Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass. I'm not saying the bass is bad, it is actually really good (the right amount of bass). It is super loud on full volume and at that volume the treble can feel a little too much. So I prefer 1 or 2 down volume for a b..."

The primary rear camera has a 13-megapixel resolution, compared to 12 megapixels on its two siblings. That might seem like a slight improvement, but the aperture is down from f/1.8 to f/2.2 which means it can't take in as much light per exposure. The front camera is unchanged at 5 megapixels and f/2.4.

6531,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.

6565,5,Worth every penny,"Here is the thing

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That’s why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

Adding to this the ste..."

6568,5,Wonderful,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly..."

This phone is really amazing. I ordered it for my wife and we click photos on this thing which are better than dslr. I own OnePlus 6t but it's camera sucks. iPhone is really amazing when it comes to camera. It's worth spending 50k on this. Cons- only display is lcd. While using u don't feel it but if u compare with other phone then u can see difference quite easily.

The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
6610,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

6615,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

6621,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
6622,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
6623,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
6624,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
6625,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."

And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
6642,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

6650,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

6652,5,Perfect product!,This is my first Apple product and obviously I was very excited before unboxing it. The phone feels very premium and truly goes with the brand.

The phone works flawlessly, with great audio and a decent speaker, for voice or music. The text feature, likewise, is extremely easy to use and intuitive.

Battery is okay...neither like it cant even run few hours nor like it will run till days...in between...you can take it with a little over mild usage....for 6 to 7 hours....."
6658,3,Nice,"An apple fan, I find iPhone 12 light, easier to use than iPhone 11 as is compact in size and weight, display is a little better than iPhone 11, speed is also better and satisfactory. To my disappointment; there was no charger and no earphones in the box. Also the price strategy of apple for its products in india is positioned much higher than the developed countries while it should have been the other way round as the capacity to pay of people of developing nations like india is much lower th..."
6659,5,Fabulous!,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones. Would definitely recommend to both iOS and android users. Good enough cameras, nice display with slim and “equal” bezels, overall a really great experience"
6660,4,Good quality product,"Well I bought this at 67k..using Amex discount! Lucky enough for that. Thanks FK & Amex
Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.
1. Picture gets pixelated when you try to zoom in even after 30 to 40% of actual image
2. Though the device houses the fastest chip across the globe (at the time of release), it still take couple of seco..."
6661,5,Just wow!,"This is my first iPhone after being an android guy for last 10yr. Main reason for the switch was, having an Macbook and airpod already. So wanted to experience synergy between apple products in its ecosystem. Here is my 2 week review
Pros
1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable
2. Performance. This phone with iOS feels extremely fluid. The old phone feels not so snappy compared to it. Also, since i have never used a 90Hz display so di..."
6662,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
6663,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."
6664,5,Highly recommended,What a phone ! Its a beast in terms of performance and great battery life. Love the red colour. Got for a great price ! My first apple phone !

6667,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.

With this purchase I have now a complete Apple products family range includes MacBook IPad and now iPhone 12. Very easy to initiate after denoting the iPhone as I had migrated all the data quickly with signing in.

Thank you Flipkart n Ekart logistics."
6672,5,Excellent,"Superb phone from apple. Buttery smooth and blazingly fast. Just missing telephoto camera at this price. This could be provided by Apple. Also charger is not coming along. At this price customer expects that.

6676,4,Nice product,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it’s a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing… cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours … if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn’t work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.

The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.

The worst thing is it’s battery. Doesn’t last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."

This phone is for someone who don't like big screen phones."

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

6738,1,Terrible product,It’s not good product ...it’s cost is more quality is not good every time is hangout..battery consumption is more at least half day also not get in ...finally my best suggestion is choose another one...
6739,5,Terrific purchase,Excellent phone from Apple... Almost same like iPhone 7 and 8 with latest processor. I can feel the speed very much compared to the iPhone 6s. It’s awesome budget phone from iPhone family.
6740,5,Simply awesome,It's a good phone for who like handy phones. But when its come to battery backup it's a worst thing. Performance of the phone is good
6741,4,Wonderful,"Performance is top notch, battery is full day easily after disabling background app Refresh ( it doesn’t effect any functionality) and some other tweaks. Camera is fantastic overall value for money if you get this in offer."
6742,4,Very Good,"Amazing phone, loved it, only issue is gets hot too much and too early. Otherwise a very good buy"
6743,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."
6744,5,Brilliant,"For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean top notch performance ......
FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY
This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch

The massive upgrade for the user who are using the iphone SE ( 1 gen) just like me"
6746,4,Wonderful,"Well, the phone is small and looks nice. It's not for people who loves bigger ones. It's basically for those people who don't use their phones for everything.
It's fast.
design is cool, sleek and beautiful. You will need a back cover for sure if you want to keep up it's beauty. P:)
battery life - not so good.
voice clarity is fine.

6747,5,Wonderful,"Like It, Apple SE very nice and handy mobile, we can use it by single hand, like it too much if you are going single handy mobile you can go with Apple SE 2020 without any hesitation."
6748,5,Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
6749,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

6765,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.
If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."

6888,5,Awesome,"Using since May 6th. And it is exceptional. Especially for pubg it's wonderful you can hear the footsteps form where they are coming. There were no problem listing music for long hours. Active noise cancellation is superb you did not hear anything around you when you plug and play.
I previously used Mi basic after 1 year one side went not working. This one has better bass and sound clarity than Mi basic headset. Go for it guys"

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
6898,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

cons:

6908,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
6909,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left. Build quality is superb, metal heads are premium looking quality. Overall in this price segment it's a good earphone."
6910,5,Worth every penny,"realme xt smartphone+Dolby Atmos+realme buds 2=Mind-blowing music experience.
Feels so premium in hands deliveries it's best sound.
I am very happy with the product.
Bass was too good you feel each and every bit of the music. MUST BUY."
6911,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
6912,5,Perfect product!,awesome in ear design. comfortable to wear. high bass. good trumph. budget friendly. I suggest you if you could afford then buy a pouch too for extra protection.❤
6913,5,Must buy!,"This is best handsfree for gaming and listing song. I also play pubg india and other games it's best for all. It has 3D voice system.
So this is best for gaming."
6914,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
6915,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.

6919,4,Nice product,"Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.
Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.
Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain."

6921,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
6922,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
6923,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
6924,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
6925,5,Terrific purchase,"It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.

Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
6930,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

Feel like sennheiser quality in low price."
6942,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

The best part is the wires have plastic coating on it which makes it perfect it would last long and it won't tore off due to folds. I can definitely garuntee you this product it's been 2 weeks since I bought it and perfect it is
6986,4,Good quality product,Product is Overall Very Good. Excellent Sound Quality And Good Bass. The Only Con. is when it is used for more than 1 hr it is not comfortable to ears. It Causes pain.
6987,5,Classy product,"Osm sound quality 5 out of 5 bass is also Better.
This is the best earphones under 600.
One more thing if anyone buy this earphone for playing pubg I suggest you that's osm earphone for pubg,no pain in my ear I am playing 2 or 3 hours but didn't feel any pain in my ear , sound quality is good Bass also good build quality little bit lower like basshead 220 build quality better than this .
One more features I like much , it has water proof ipx4 sertification that's osm.
Earphone delivery very I..."
6988,5,Excellent,Excellent buy just purchased a day back n pretty much satisfied with the product. The delivery was a day before so happy with the service. Quality of the earphone is excellent can hear the voice loud and clear.
6989,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
6990,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
6991,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
6992,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
6993,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
6994,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs. Bass is good not that great but yeah it's ok for me. By the way i am not a bass lover. This headphone really justifies the price. Trust me it's a very good headphone. You r going to love it.
6995,4,Good quality product,"Amazing literally awesome wire quality too good and sound and bass also epic you can surely use it for gaming also and it fits quite better in ears and no pain in my ears after wearing it for 3-4 hours

6998,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It's one of the best earphone at this price range i recommend to go with this if u wanta pure sound quality and bass quality.

7015,5,Perfect product!,"Writing this review post 1 month of usage.

Sound quality is good, Bass is also good. Worth the money. The only demerit is the metal plug, sometimes it gets tough to unplug it due to slippery texture. Rest all good. I would recommend to buy this without any hesitation."
7016,4,Worth the money,It was very smooth and clear bass and it is very stylish look.I like it .superr
7017,5,Highly recommended,It is a nice product but comparing this with basshead 100. In my opinion basshead 100 is better than fitting in ear easily. Not ideal product for using it normally to watch movies. For sports activity it is great

7019,4,Good quality product,"Sound quality is good for the price. I'm a music producer so I know a little bit about sound. Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass. I'm not saying the bass is bad, it is actually really good (the right amount of bass). It is super loud on full volume and at that volume the treble can feel a little too much. So I prefer 1 or 2 down volume for a b..."

7379,5,Wonderful,Super and marvellous phone look very cute and nice sound. I love this phone i think white is good colur.Excellent camer 5*😍😘♥️♥️
7380,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
7381,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
7382,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it. Would recommed only if you have the budget.
7383,4,Pretty good,"I was using Iphone 6s and also Oneplus 6t. Both mobiles were perfectly alright in Photos, gaming, and smooth interface . My 6s mobile getting battery issue. thought upgrade to 11.

As for as the processing is concerned, it runs without any lag. You can play and do whatever you want without a glitch.

The battery runs for a day with medium and high workload.

The display is good and the speakers are working fine.

The earphones doesn't have any base and you can use it for calling mostly.

The charging time is approximately for 90 minutes for full charging..."

I purchased Apple iPhone 11. with an exchange of IPhone 7, the exchange did not go well, iPhone 7 had a small scratch out side screen which i could never identify till date, but the FLIPKART person could, so he reduced 50% from exchange rate. I decided not to trade in, but paid money.

Delivery was fast as well
..it was a gift for my sister and she loved it so much."
7407,1,Worthless,"Phone is awesome no doubt. But Camera & Display is not great. Performance is mind blowing.
But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."
7408,5,Super!,"Did an upgrade from 6s plus to iphone 11.
Ao far the experience is well and good. Felt smoother than 6s plus. The camera quality is superb. Battery backup is descent. Not a heavy user, and gets power more than a day. Go for it if you need an alrounder iphone in a competitve price."
7409,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."
7410,5,Super!,"This is my first ever iPhone.
And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.
Comparing will only make you confused.

7415,5,Worth every penny,"Here is the thing

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That’s why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

7418,5,Wonderful,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly..."

Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Cost is very high.

Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
7472,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
7473,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
7474,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
7475,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
7492,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

7500,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

7512,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
7513,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

7558,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn’t matter so much. Display is ok. Its a nice display but a small one a..."
7559,5,Terrific purchase,Its a great product. Would have given more than 5 star for the performance. Camera quality is much better than 20MP . And it operates at lighting fast pace. The only small minus point is battery. A but as i am a moderate user its perfectly fine for me. Great product as usual from apple.🙌🏻
7560,4,Value-for-money,"USP:
1. Compact mobile which i always wanted in iPhone models
2. Kickass A13 bionic chip , one of the best energy efficient apple processor produced till date.
3. Camera is awesome to take pics (only day time) 4K videos 30/60 fps.

Downside:
1. Battery drain very fast.(googled and made it battery efficient) now it last atleast 1.5 day with moderate usage.

Note: i would not advice this compact super mobile for people who are always glued to social media and YouTube.

This is for someone who w..."

7573,4,Nice product,"It’s a beast in performance, only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand.

7583,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
7589,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

7699,5,Brilliant,"It's a interesting product so I'm writing this after 24 hours of burn out.. so stay tuned to know the full story.. eartips are silicone tips very comfortable but doesn't stay in my ear much well, but your mileage may vary.. build is great but after receiving my item I noticed scuffs and nylons coming off a little from the part near 3.5 mm port.. otherwise it's built really well.. speakers for calls is tremendous easily putting mi basics to shame.. it's great for people like me who talks a lot..."
7700,5,Great product,"Sound quality is really good... Better than boat bass 200,225.. i have used many earphones like JBL , Skullcandy,boat,bout,leaf,bose,sony etc.. but i fell this is also good as leaf bolt ... I love it😍.."
7701,5,Simply awesome,What a immersive experience on the headphones...when i listen music on them it feels like i'm sitting in any live show... best sound quality i've ever experienced on this price range. superb realme it wroth the price.. Its looks are also cool to see with yellow lines. The button of the remote are tactile and easy to use and differentiate. The sound goes to extreme volume no trouble after long hours of use.
7702,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."

7718,5,Awesome,"Using since May 6th. And it is exceptional. Especially for pubg it's wonderful you can hear the footsteps form where they are coming. There were no problem listing music for long hours. Active noise cancellation is superb you did not hear anything around you when you plug and play.
I previously used Mi basic after 1 year one side went not working. This one has better bass and sound clarity than Mi basic headset. Go for it guys"

7727,5,Awesome,"Writing review after 6 months of daily use..
Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
7728,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

5.Call quality is clearly delivered to whos speak with us

cons:
1. its a straight cable not triangle
2.Not Gold plated 3.5mm Jack"
7738,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
7739,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left. Build quality is superb, metal heads are premium looking quality. Overall in this price segment it's a good earphone."
7740,5,Worth every penny,"realme xt smartphone+Dolby Atmos+realme buds 2=Mind-blowing music experience.
Feels so premium in hands deliveries it's best sound.
I am very happy with the product.
Bass was too good you feel each and every bit of the music. MUST BUY."
7741,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
7742,5,Perfect product!,awesome in ear design. comfortable to wear. high bass. good trumph. budget friendly. I suggest you if you could afford then buy a pouch too for extra protection.❤
7743,5,Must buy!,"This is best handsfree for gaming and listing song. I also play pubg india and other games it's best for all. It has 3D voice system.
So this is best for gaming."
7744,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
7745,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.

7749,4,Nice product,"Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.
Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.
Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain."

7751,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
7752,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."

Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
7754,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."

But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
7760,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

7800,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
7801,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."
7802,1,Absolute rubbish! VERY BAD for CALLING,"If you buying this earphone for CALLING don't buy this. I received earphone and i try this. For calling it creating extra distortion in voice. If you buying for MUSIC then good earphone. I return the earphone and after return i got new earphone then again same problem. i already have Boat 100 hawk design that earphone good for calling. I STRONGLY RECOMMENDED DON'T BUY boat 242 for whatsapp or any other internet calling .

CALLING -- 0/5
MUSIC -- 5/5
DESIGN -- 4/5
BASS -- 5/5
CLARITY IN MUSIC ..."
7803,5,Highly recommended,"first of all the product delivered within 24 hours.
here comes the main product and its specs--
1. Built & Design: it has good quality material and also the quality of wire is above average. Also the wire is tangle free so it is another advantage of it.
2. Sound Quality: nothing to say about the sound quality as it produces good bass and trebles are in balance, it has 10 mm drivers but doesn't seems like as the volume is better than realme earbuds.
3. Comfort: It fits in the ear nicely.

7804,4,Wonderful,Clear hd sound with good bass. Best thing is braided wire mostly the wire of earphone is too sensitive to mechanical stress. So i spent my money for this earphone. And i am happy with this earphone bass is also good not much bass but you can listen balance sound. Sound is clear and clean. Every single minute detailed sound you can listen on this earphone and for playing PUBG.
7805,4,Delightful,"Compared it with Sennheiser cx180. Bass is smooth in this set but Sennheiser has high treble with boom bass.
So, If you campare everything this master piece is best for everyone and everything like jugging, jyming and listening songs. I love it. ,"

7812,3,Nice,"Overall moderate quality in-ear headphone.

Pros:
Sweat proof
Tangle free wire
10mm driver for better sound
Good bass level

Cons:
Moderate build quality, colour peeling off from various parts in one month of usage.

Switch controls not so good. Overall quality could be much better as compared to other products from boat in this price range"
7813,5,Wonderful,"Delivered before the delivery date, quality and bass is the best at this price point after using 1 week I m rating this. Worth of purchase.. Makes me happy"

7820,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes . Boat should have provided more ear hooks of different sizes so it could be comfortable for everyone if you have normal or big sized ears , this product will be perfect for you the sound quality is very good, built quality is very good wire length is perfect . This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for me
Thankyou"

If you want cheaper and good wired earphones."
7827,5,Perfect product!,"I write this review after 9 days of usage. In the beginning I feel lil bit of pain in my ears because boat earphones are different from others in terms of shape and design. So after two to three days of uses my ears are used to it and I am comfortable with that. .

7842,3,Just okay,Sound quality is good but ear hurts after long usage. It firmly holds its position in ear which quite good for some users but ok for short period of time. Over all sound is good bass is better and wire design is strong.
7843,3,Decent product,"Good design and sound quality (although I am not a fan of bass headphones). I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great. Lots of issues like sound loop, echoes, other person unable to hear loud and clear if the wires are hanging (like in normal cases). If you bring the mic close to the mouth, only then you are properly audible + echoes are there no matter what. So, all in all it is good for those who likes bass headphones, but don't r..."
7844,4,Value-for-money,This review is after 1 month of use. The performance is great worth money but one thing lacks is the build of 2 rubber like support near the earphones it got loosed and streched within a week too poor quality rubber user whereas the wire are little thick and good that's comfortable. The only thing I am not satisfied with the product is the the rubbers near the ear too poor quality rubbers used overall performance is great good for gaming...... One more suggestions don't purchase the lime gre...
7845,4,Nice product,The perfect wired headset at the lowest price. The sound quality is brilliant and it is perfectly fit. The best part is the wires have plastic coating on it which makes it perfect it would last long and it won't tore off due to folds. I can definitely garuntee you this product it's been 2 weeks since I bought it and perfect it is
7846,4,Good quality product,Product is Overall Very Good. Excellent Sound Quality And Good Bass. The Only Con. is when it is used for more than 1 hr it is not comfortable to ears. It Causes pain.
7847,5,Classy product,"Osm sound quality 5 out of 5 bass is also Better.
This is the best earphones under 600.

7849,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
7850,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
7851,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
7852,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
7853,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
7854,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs. Bass is good not that great but yeah it's ok for me. By the way i am not a bass lover. This headphone really justifies the price. Trust me it's a very good headphone. You r going to love it.

Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass.

I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.
8181,4,Nice product,"Awesome Phone. Slightly high price but worth. Better than iPhone XR.
Camera is superb and wide angle camera is very clear.

8187,5,Great product,Again back to apple iphone after a gap of 2-3 years. It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.

So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
8211,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
8212,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."

8239,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."

And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn’t waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black.

8284,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating. I don’t know if the problem is only with my device or its general,..."

Ios 14 is much polished and android users will surely enjoy using ios now. Battry lasts a day with moderate use. Performance, usability, camera, sound and display everything is top notch.

Battery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day.
Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
8290,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

8293,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
8294,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
8295,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use
3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."

8301,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
8302,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
8303,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
8304,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
8305,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."

Once I got the product first thing I did was to check the serial number in the apple website and confirm the originality of the product. I was very happy as everything was perfect.

8319,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.
- Square-shaped design co..."
8320,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

Camera: it’s superb.
Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use.

8332,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
8333,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

8337,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products.

The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.

The BEST thing about this phone is it’s size. So easy to use this phone singe handedly. Excellent grip. Fits very crisply in pockets.

The worst thing is it’s battery. Doesn’t last long. Better to have a power bank to avoid sudden switch off."

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition!

Its looks are also cool to see with yellow lines. The button of the remote are tactile and easy to use and differentiate. The sound goes to extreme volume no trouble after long hours of use.
8532,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
8558,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
8569,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left. Build quality is superb, metal heads are premium looking quality. Overall in this price segment it's a good earphone."

Bass was too good you feel each and every bit of the music. MUST BUY."
8571,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
8572,5,Perfect product!,awesome in ear design. comfortable to wear. high bass. good trumph. budget friendly. I suggest you if you could afford then buy a pouch too for extra protection.❤

So this is best for gaming."
8574,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .

8581,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
8582,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
8583,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
8584,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
8585,5,Terrific purchase,"It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.

8587,4,Value-for-money,"So after a lot of confusion ended up with senhinser cx213, 1more piston fit, jbl t110 & realme buds 2
Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.
Few things I would like be get added..."
8588,5,Classy product,The Sound quality is superb and the base quality is also good ..The point thing which I liked in this earphone is that its durability ..the wire quality is good ..before I was using the sennheiser cx275 ..the wire got cut from middle ..I am happy with this earphones.
8589,4,Wonderful,"This earphone is truly worth it's price i.e. 500. Got it 2 days ago and using it since then. Sound quality is awsm and bass too. The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
8590,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

This is my second pair of these earp..."
8591,4,Value-for-money,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume. But I know most of average Indians who are looking for a budget earphone will most certainly lov..."

8599,5,Terrific,"The quality of the earphone is very good it may comepete with the earphones which are about 1500 rs to 2000 rs the bass and treble are so nice but due to bass the vocals may affected a little but in your day to day usage you don't feel but those who are bass lovers like me the absolutely prefer this earphone

I am happy with quality. No distortion of sound at any point. Bass and treble perfect balance. You will really not getting any outer noise after plug-in it in ear. Feel like sennheiser quality in low price."
8612,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."
8613,5,Just wow!,"Writing this review after a year of using this

Realme released Buds 2 Neo which is 100 cheaper than this but go for Buds 2 instead of Neo and Buds 2 has more premium and sturdy cable.

I tried different types of wired earphones in the past under 1k price range including boat, sony, jbl etc but none of them lasted more than 6 months for my usage, but the best budget earphones for me is Redmi Basic which is under 399 but they are not available since 1 year so I had to buy Realme buds 2 which ..."

8630,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
8631,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."
8632,1,Absolute rubbish! VERY BAD for CALLING,"If you buying this earphone for CALLING don't buy this. I received earphone and i try this. For calling it creating extra distortion in voice. If you buying for MUSIC then good earphone. I return the earphone and after return i got new earphone then again same problem. i already have Boat 100 hawk design that earphone good for calling.

here comes the main product and its specs--
1. Built & Design: it has good quality material and also the quality of wire is above average. Also the wire is tangle free so it is another advantage of it.

8634,4,Wonderful,Clear hd sound with good bass. Best thing is braided wire mostly the wire of earphone is too sensitive to mechanical stress. So i spent my money for this earphone. And i am happy with this earphone bass is also good not much bass but you can listen balance sound. Sound is clear and clean. Every single minute detailed sound you can listen on this earphone and for playing PUBG.
8635,4,Delightful,"Compared it with Sennheiser cx180. Bass is smooth in this set but Sennheiser has high treble with boom bass.
So, If you campare everything this master piece is best for everyone and everything like jugging, jyming and listening songs. I love it. ,"

8642,3,Nice,"Overall moderate quality in-ear headphone.

Pros:
Sweat proof
Tangle free wire
10mm driver for better sound
Good bass level

Cons:
Moderate build quality, colour peeling off from various parts in one month of usage.

Switch controls not so good. Overall quality could be much better as compared to other products from boat in this price range"
8643,5,Wonderful,"Delivered before the delivery date, quality and bass is the best at this price point after using 1 week I m rating this. Worth of purchase.. Makes me happy"
8644,5,Terrific purchase,Sound quality is good sturdy and stylish design worth for money

8650,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes . Boat should have provided more ear hooks of different sizes so it could be comfortable for everyone if you have normal or big sized ears , this product will be perfect for you the sound quality is very good, built quality is very good wire length is perfect . This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for me

8673,3,Decent product,"Good design and sound quality (although I am not a fan of bass headphones). I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great. Lots of issues like sound loop, echoes, other person unable to hear loud and clear if the wires are hanging (like in normal cases).

8678,5,Excellent,Excellent buy just purchased a day back n pretty much satisfied with the product. The delivery was a day before so happy with the service. Quality of the earphone is excellent can hear the voice loud and clear.
8679,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
8680,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
8681,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
8682,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
8683,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
8684,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs. Bass is good not that great but yeah it's ok for me. By the way i am not a bass lover. This headphone really justifies the price. Trust me it's a very good headphone. You r going to love it.
8685,4,Good quality product,"Amazing literally awesome wire quality too good and sound and bass also epic you can surely use it for gaming also and it fits quite better in ears and no pain in my ears after wearing it for 3-4 hours

I have jbl 100tws but sound much better than jbl.Bass is awesome with mimimum sound volume"

Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass. I'm not saying the bass is bad, it is actually really good (the right amount of bass). It is super loud on full volume and at that volume the treble can feel a little too much. So I prefer 1 or 2 down volume for a b..."

9061,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

9087,1,Worthless,"Phone is awesome no doubt. But Camera & Display is not great. Performance is mind blowing.
But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."
9088,5,Super!,"Did an upgrade from 6s plus to iphone 11.
Ao far the experience is well and good. Felt smoother than 6s plus. The camera quality is superb. Battery backup is descent. Not a heavy user, and gets power more than a day. Go for it if you need an alrounder iphone in a competitve price."
9089,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don’t think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."
9090,5,Super!,"This is my first ever iPhone.
And I truly don’t regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you’re obsessed with photos and videos, just don’t think twice or don’t compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it’s far better from them in every field.
Comparing will only make you confused.

9095,5,Worth every penny,"Here is the thing

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I’m not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That’s why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

9098,5,Wonderful,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly..."

This phone is really amazing. I ordered it for my wife and we click photos on this thing which are better than dslr.

The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
9140,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone.

Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
9152,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
9153,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
9154,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
9155,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance.

9171,5,Awesome,"An absolute charm to have this phone in your hands. Flipkart delivered in the next day in the BBD sale. Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
9172,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."
9173,5,Best in the market!,"Perfect iPhone . Glad that I Pick iPhone 12 instead of iPhone 11 , Prices are bit high but Features are completely fill that Price Gap . I love that Device . Happy User 😁"

9177,5,Must buy!,Great service by Flipkart. Iphone 12 is just awesome. The only con is they must provide charger. The battery is not that much great but works for a day if sufficiently charged.

9179,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.

9180,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

Camera: it’s superb.
Battery : quite good and runs for whole day if moderately use.

9189,5,Fabulous!,"The most value for money iPhone of 2021 after the iPhone 12 mini. Flipkart just killed it with their pricing and offers on these iPhones.

Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.

Pros
1. Screen Quality is great. My last phone was Oneplus 7, so jump in screen quality was noticeable

9192,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
9193,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

First confused about colour but as compared with others Red does look Royal"
9197,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.
9198,5,Classy product,Got an iphone 12 128gb green colour as I expected thanks for flipcart. And when it comes to phone iphone is good and i love purple colour but i got green but it's ok when it comes to its performance and camera excellent and battery backup and charging speed is also good..💭♥️

9257,5,Best in the market!,"It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it, the camera is a beast, the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use, if ur a heavy user you'd need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get rlly good gameplay, worth the money, btw if ur coming for a larger screen, you might feel it's a lil too small but honestly it's not rlly that small, so buy it, it's perfect."
9258,4,Value-for-money,"Battery will give good performance for a normal user
I suggest another variant for heavy users
Cam quality is good in day light conditions

9263,4,Nice product,"It’s a beast in performance, only thing that I didn’t like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn’t break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand. I’ve been using it for more than 9 months. It is really a great device if..."

Definetely a Value for your Buck."

9273,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

battery life - not so good.

9278,5,Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
9279,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don’t like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price.

9399,5,Brilliant,"It's a interesting product so I'm writing this after 24 hours of burn out.. so stay tuned to know the full story.. eartips are silicone tips very comfortable but doesn't stay in my ear much well, but your mileage may vary.. build is great but after receiving my item I noticed scuffs and nylons coming off a little from the part near 3.5 mm port.. otherwise it's built really well.. speakers for calls is tremendous easily putting mi basics to shame.. it's great for people like me who talks a lot..."

Its looks are also cool to see with yellow lines. The button of the remote are tactile and easy to use and differentiate. The sound goes to extreme volume no trouble after long hours of use.
9402,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."

9418,5,Awesome,"Using since May 6th. And it is exceptional. Especially for pubg it's wonderful you can hear the footsteps form where they are coming. There were no problem listing music for long hours. Active noise cancellation is superb you did not hear anything around you when you plug and play.
I previously used Mi basic after 1 year one side went not working. This one has better bass and sound clarity than Mi basic headset. Go for it guys"

9427,5,Awesome,"Writing review after 6 months of daily use..
Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
9428,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

4.Cable organizer is usefull to carry pick up your earphone safetly
5.Call quality is clearly delivered to whos speak with us

cons:
1. its a straight cable not triangle
2.Not Gold plated 3.5mm Jack"
9438,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
9439,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left. Build quality is superb, metal heads are premium looking quality. Overall in this price segment it's a good earphone."
9440,5,Worth every penny,"realme xt smartphone+Dolby Atmos+realme buds 2=Mind-blowing music experience.
Feels so premium in hands deliveries it's best sound.
I am very happy with the product.
Bass was too good you feel each and every bit of the music. MUST BUY."
9441,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
9442,5,Perfect product!,awesome in ear design. comfortable to wear. high bass. good trumph. budget friendly. I suggest you if you could afford then buy a pouch too for extra protection.❤
9443,5,Must buy!,"This is best handsfree for gaming and listing song. I also play pubg india and other games it's best for all. It has 3D voice system.
So this is best for gaming."
9444,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
9445,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.

9449,4,Nice product,"Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.
Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.
Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain."
9450,5,Best in the market!,"realme buds 2 is the best earphones. Perfect for people who like the bass. Sound quality is awesome. Audio is balanced and every instrument is clearly heard.At the price of 500 rupees, it cannot be better than this."
9451,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
9452,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
9453,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
9454,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
9455,5,Terrific purchase,"It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
9460,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

9500,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
9501,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."
9502,1,Absolute rubbish! VERY BAD for CALLING,"If you buying this earphone for CALLING don't buy this. I received earphone and i try this. For calling it creating extra distortion in voice. If you buying for MUSIC then good earphone. I return the earphone and after return i got new earphone then again same problem. i already have Boat 100 hawk design that earphone good for calling. I STRONGLY RECOMMENDED DON'T BUY boat 242 for whatsapp or any other internet calling .

CALLING -- 0/5
MUSIC -- 5/5
DESIGN -- 4/5
BASS -- 5/5
CLARITY IN MUSIC ..."
9503,5,Highly recommended,"first of all the product delivered within 24 hours.
here comes the main product and its specs--
1. Built & Design: it has good quality material and also the quality of wire is above average. Also the wire is tangle free so it is another advantage of it.
2. Sound Quality: nothing to say about the sound quality as it produces good bass and trebles are in balance, it has 10 mm drivers but doesn't seems like as the volume is better than realme earbuds.
3. Comfort: It fits in the ear nicely.

9504,4,Wonderful,Clear hd sound with good bass. Best thing is braided wire mostly the wire of earphone is too sensitive to mechanical stress. So i spent my money for this earphone. And i am happy with this earphone bass is also good not much bass but you can listen balance sound. Sound is clear and clean. Every single minute detailed sound you can listen on this earphone and for playing PUBG.
9505,4,Delightful,"Compared it with Sennheiser cx180. Bass is smooth in this set but Sennheiser has high treble with boom bass.
So, If you campare everything this master piece is best for everyone and everything like jugging, jyming and listening songs. I love it. ,"

9512,3,Nice,"Overall moderate quality in-ear headphone.

Pros:
Sweat proof
Tangle free wire
10mm driver for better sound
Good bass level

Cons:
Moderate build quality, colour peeling off from various parts in one month of usage.

Switch controls not so good. Overall quality could be much better as compared to other products from boat in this price range"
9513,5,Wonderful,"Delivered before the delivery date, quality and bass is the best at this price point after using 1 week I m rating this. Worth of purchase.. Makes me happy"

9520,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes . Boat should have provided more ear hooks of different sizes so it could be comfortable for everyone if you have normal or big sized ears , this product will be perfect for you the sound quality is very good, built quality is very good wire length is perfect . This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for me
Thankyou"

If you want cheaper and good wired earphones."
9527,5,Perfect product!,"I write this review after 9 days of usage. In the beginning I feel lil bit of pain in my ears because boat earphones are different from others in terms of shape and design. So after two to three days of uses my ears are used to it and I am comfortable with that. .

9542,3,Just okay,Sound quality is good but ear hurts after long usage. It firmly holds its position in ear which quite good for some users but ok for short period of time. Over all sound is good bass is better and wire design is strong.
9543,3,Decent product,"Good design and sound quality (although I am not a fan of bass headphones). I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great. Lots of issues like sound loop, echoes, other person unable to hear loud and clear if the wires are hanging (like in normal cases). If you bring the mic close to the mouth, only then you are properly audible + echoes are there no matter what. So, all in all it is good for those who likes bass headphones, but don't r..."
9544,4,Value-for-money,This review is after 1 month of use. The performance is great worth money but one thing lacks is the build of 2 rubber like support near the earphones it got loosed and streched within a week too poor quality rubber user whereas the wire are little thick and good that's comfortable. The only thing I am not satisfied with the product is the the rubbers near the ear too poor quality rubbers used overall performance is great good for gaming...... One more suggestions don't purchase the lime gre...
9545,4,Nice product,The perfect wired headset at the lowest price. The sound quality is brilliant and it is perfectly fit. The best part is the wires have plastic coating on it which makes it perfect it would last long and it won't tore off due to folds. I can definitely garuntee you this product it's been 2 weeks since I bought it and perfect it is
9546,4,Good quality product,Product is Overall Very Good. Excellent Sound Quality And Good Bass. The Only Con. is when it is used for more than 1 hr it is not comfortable to ears. It Causes pain.
9547,5,Classy product,"Osm sound quality 5 out of 5 bass is also Better.
This is the best earphones under 600.

9549,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
9550,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
9551,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
9552,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
9553,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
9554,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs. Bass is good not that great but yeah it's ok for me. By the way i am not a bass lover. This headphone really justifies the price. Trust me it's a very good headphone. You r going to love it.

Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass.

Still exploring its features. And can’t forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.

So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
9941,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
9942,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.

And I’m posting this review after using it for 4 days."

Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂

10014,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
10020,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
10024,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
10025,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use
3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

Pros:

Cost is very high.
Battery backup is not good, it gives only 8hrs like previous versions."

10031,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
10032,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
10033,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
10034,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it’s a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it’s worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
10035,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I’m loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it’s very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."

Camera, display, looks, performance, smooth interface is all that makes iphones standout from rest. And iphone 12 delivers all that you require. Though iPhone's battery has always been the downside. Apple if you are listening we need much more larger battery capacity and you wont have to face any competition.
And thankfull we didn't get Nirma soap in our box😂"
10052,4,Pretty good,"As switched from an android to ios it's worth upgrading .However ,there are some things particularly in iOS which i dislike for instance,it's a big challenge to transfer your data to a laptop unless it's a MacBook. Overall i can say the camera quality is top notch and processor which we all know it's the fastest chip yet furthermore the security we get is far better than android devices moreover thanks to flipkart for delivering the product earlier than the scheduled date."

10059,5,"Great iPhone, but you have to consider these options","Pros:
- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.

10060,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it’s not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It’s top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
10073,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

10077,5,Must buy!,It's maintaining apple's quality as usual. Good phone and compatibility use. The phone is little bit small when compared to other competitive products. There is no outstanding features in this phone when compare to Samsung or one plus. But I'm sure Apple uses must love this phone. The seller is also very good and they keep promising to deliver things on time for meeting Beyond expectations.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

10163,5,Just wow!,"I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand.

But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.

iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s ,

And bought this one. So my review Gonna be comparison between them.
PRICE: 1.Realme 599(when I bought)
2.Boult loop 449( when I bought)
Sound quality: BOTH ARE AMAZING GIVES PERFECT SOUND.
BASS: BOTH ARE GOOD BUT REALME BUDS GIVES A more punchy bass which causes a headache after long time use.
BUILD : BOTH ARE GOOD BUT BOULT FITS PERFECT AND FEELS GOOD .
TREBLES: BOULT.

Bulit Quality Is really good Very Durable Cable Quality
really Liked The Products
Let's See How Long does It Last for?"
10307,5,Awesome,"Writing review after 6 months of daily use..
Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
10308,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

2.Bass is Awsome
3.Design and build quality excellent
4.Cable organizer is usefull to carry pick up your earphone safetly
5.Call quality is clearly delivered to whos speak with us

cons:
1. its a straight cable not triangle
2.Not Gold plated 3.5mm Jack"
10318,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
10319,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left. Build quality is superb, metal heads are premium looking quality. Overall in this price segment it's a good earphone."
10320,5,Worth every penny,"realme xt smartphone+Dolby Atmos+realme buds 2=Mind-blowing music experience.
Feels so premium in hands deliveries it's best sound.
I am very happy with the product.
Bass was too good you feel each and every bit of the music. MUST BUY."
10321,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
10322,5,Perfect product!,awesome in ear design. comfortable to wear. high bass. good trumph. budget friendly. I suggest you if you could afford then buy a pouch too for extra protection.❤
10323,5,Must buy!,"This is best handsfree for gaming and listing song. I also play pubg india and other games it's best for all. It has 3D voice system.
So this is best for gaming."
10324,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
10325,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.
🙏🤟"
10326,5,Perfect product!,best earphones I have ever buy in life soft and clear sound bass is little bit low but it doesn't effect the sound just fabulous
10327,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First of the design is so nice, the texture of the colour is amazing.. Now came to sound quality..I didn't expect it will be this good!! The bass is perfect for ears .. I really feel enjoyed whenever i listen any songs through this headset.. really satisfied for this product... recommend everyone to buy it and enjoy..Thank you."
10328,5,Must buy!,Excellent product it has amazing sound and amazing bass It is better that jbl and boat and value for money
10329,4,Nice product,"Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.
Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.
Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain."
10330,5,Best in the market!,"realme buds 2 is the best earphones. Perfect for people who like the bass. Sound quality is awesome. Audio is balanced and every instrument is clearly heard.At the price of 500 rupees, it cannot be better than this."
10331,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
10332,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
10333,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
10334,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
10335,5,Terrific purchase,"It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.
One more thing.... The cable organizer helps a lot while keeping the earphone safe and organized while travelling and keeping in jeans pocket.

Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

10339,4,Wonderful,"This earphone is truly worth it's price i.e. 500. Got it 2 days ago and using it since then. Sound quality is awsm and bass too. The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
10340,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

This is my second pair of these earp..."
10341,4,Value-for-money,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

Feel like sennheiser quality in low price."
10362,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

10380,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
10381,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."

Every single minute detailed sound you can listen on this earphone and for playing PUBG.
10385,4,Delightful,"Compared it with Sennheiser cx180. Bass is smooth in this set but Sennheiser has high treble with boom bass.

Pros:
Sweat proof
Tangle free wire

Good bass level

Cons:
Moderate build quality, colour peeling off from various parts in one month of usage.

Switch controls not so good. Overall quality could be much better as compared to other products from boat in this price range"

10400,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes . Boat should have provided more ear hooks of different sizes so it could be comfortable for everyone if you have normal or big sized ears , this product will be perfect for you the sound quality is very good, built quality is very good wire length is perfect . This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for me

10408,5,Must buy!,Good base...its good for workouts and all that..you can remove the in ear hook and use it as normal bud one.. decent music quality..
10409,5,Mind-blowing purchase,What a sound quality totaly worth the money. i loved this one but boAt bassheads 225 has more booming bass then this one. I am not saying it doesn't have deep bass it has but not that deep which a bass lover likes but it has crystal clear sound quality which let's you experience clear sound with deep bass overall i am in love with these earphones.
10410,3,Nice,Amazing earphones treble and bass is very good but the treble is very loud you cant wear it very long time it cause pain but overall quality is good if you can afford sony mdr ex150ap go for it sony is great than boat and skull candy
10411,5,Wonderful,"I would suggest this earphone to those peoples who loves PUBG or online gaming. Because the sound is really good and it easily fit in your ear. I bought this earphone at 549rs. And comparing to realme bud 2, Realme bud2 is good in base."

3: Music quality I'll say it's not the best but it's not the worst too. It has average bass but vocals are really good. 3/5 [ I have tried the realme buds 2 and buds 2 neo that comes in same price segment and their music quality and bass is really amazing ]

4: For Gamers this will not disappoint you. You can easily read enemy foot ste..."

10416,5,Brilliant,"a really nice earphone for music
....and superb for mobile gaming
it supports surround sound..
bass is little less compared to the bassheads 225 but is not like it has no bass......its bass is balanced i would say as more bass than this causes problem in gaming and after playing shooting games ur head will become vibrator.....overall they are good ear phones"
10417,5,Just wow!,"I always loves Boat Accessories. I Got my favourite colour Red-Black edition, k received it less than 48 hrs from orderd. I loves fastest ever delivery 🙂❤️"

10421,5,Fabulous!,"Very good quality and perfectly Balanced sound.
And boat always at its best"
10422,3,Just okay,Sound quality is good but ear hurts after long usage. It firmly holds its position in ear which quite good for some users but ok for short period of time. Over all sound is good bass is better and wire design is strong.
10423,3,Decent product,"Good design and sound quality (although I am not a fan of bass headphones). I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great. Lots of issues like sound loop, echoes, other person unable to hear loud and clear if the wires are hanging (like in normal cases). If you bring the mic close to the mouth, only then you are properly audible + echoes are there no matter what. So, all in all it is good for those who likes bass headphones, but don't r..."
10424,4,Value-for-money,This review is after 1 month of use. The performance is great worth money but one thing lacks is the build of 2 rubber like support near the earphones it got loosed and streched within a week too poor quality rubber user whereas the wire are little thick and good that's comfortable. The only thing I am not satisfied with the product is the the rubbers near the ear too poor quality rubbers used overall performance is great good for gaming...... One more suggestions don't purchase the lime gre...
10425,4,Nice product,The perfect wired headset at the lowest price. The sound quality is brilliant and it is perfectly fit. The best part is the wires have plastic coating on it which makes it perfect it would last long and it won't tore off due to folds. I can definitely garuntee you this product it's been 2 weeks since I bought it and perfect it is
10426,4,Good quality product,Product is Overall Very Good. Excellent Sound Quality And Good Bass. The Only Con. is when it is used for more than 1 hr it is not comfortable to ears. It Causes pain.
10427,5,Classy product,"Osm sound quality 5 out of 5 bass is also Better.
This is the best earphones under 600.
One more thing if anyone buy this earphone for playing pubg I suggest you that's osm earphone for pubg,no pain in my ear I am playing 2 or 3 hours but didn't feel any pain in my ear , sound quality is good Bass also good build quality little bit lower like basshead 220 build quality better than this .

10428,5,Excellent,Excellent buy just purchased a day back n pretty much satisfied with the product. The delivery was a day before so happy with the service. Quality of the earphone is excellent can hear the voice loud and clear.
10429,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
10430,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
10431,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
10432,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
10433,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
10434,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs. Bass is good not that great but yeah it's ok for me. By the way i am not a bass lover. This headphone really justifies the price. Trust me it's a very good headphone. You r going to love it.
10435,4,Good quality product,"Amazing literally awesome wire quality too good and sound and bass also epic you can surely use it for gaming also and it fits quite better in ears and no pain in my ears after wearing it for 3-4 hours

10454,4,Worth the money,Good product for the price range not comparable to semheiser or JBL 700range earphone but at this budget it's good fit in ears and comfortable to use ... Hope it last long wire looks thin and bass is good but I wanted it for movie for movies it's good but this is made for bass music and again it's perfect fit in ears
10455,5,Perfect product!,"Writing this review post 1 month of usage.

Sound quality is good, Bass is also good. Worth the money. The only demerit is the metal plug, sometimes it gets tough to unplug it due to slippery texture. Rest all good. I would recommend to buy this without any hesitation."

10457,5,Highly recommended,It is a nice product but comparing this with basshead 100. In my opinion basshead 100 is better than fitting in ear easily. Not ideal product for using it normally to watch movies. For sports activity it is great

10459,4,Good quality product,"Sound quality is good for the price. I'm a music producer so I know a little bit about sound. Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass. I'm not saying the bass is bad, it is actually really good (the right amount of bass). It is super loud on full volume and at that volume the treble can feel a little too much. So I prefer 1 or 2 down volume for a b..."

'THANK YOU'"
10577,5,Great product,It's a nice product for the price good sound quality and also it maintains a good bass also but it not suitable for play pubg very deficult to spot enimes mi basic headset is better for play pubg at this price range
10578,2,Expected a better product,These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.
10579,1,Utterly Disappointed,"Am using MI earphones which is available almost for the same price. I used them upto two years, they were still performing well, base and voice quality. But I lost them, so I thought to order them again, but watching all the reviews I bought this earphones. These earphones are very disappointing. There is no proper lock-in , and during calls you can't hear other people's voice clearly, and they are too much loud, unbearable to ears, even if we adjusted low volume in our mobile.

10654,5,Wonderful,Perfect bass and sound quality for me. Before this earphone I used to use JBL. To be honest I didn't regard at all after purchase this BoAt product. 4.5 out of 5 for me.

Pros:
1. Sound quality is nice at this price
2. I m using it from 5 months and it is working good as same as before .
3. Classy look.
4. Magnet is present at the back side of buds

Cons.
1. Bass is ok ..not much good
If you are looking for a good bass earphone go for another one..or model 242 has very good bass
2. For listening music and watching movies it is good but for calling its Jack disturb many times..not good for calling ."

10661,4,Pretty good,Sound is awesome just because of high bass sound become quite sharp from my point of view boat bass head100 was better in sound as well as in design too
10662,5,Simply awesome,"the sound quality and the bass is really good, the clarity of sound is as comparable with the apple earpods that comes with the iPhone, I was in dire need for such an earphone that sounded just like apple earpods but also shouldn't be heavy on my pocket.
inshort great sound quality, good design and bang for the buck. go for it."
10663,4,Nice product,"Value for money.
Below 399, I believe this is really a good one.
Sound quality is nice but please don't expect it to be a Sennheiser one.
Bass is okay if you increase the volume or bass settings in your device, you can have the effect but it is very average quality.
Build is good

Lastly I want to thank Flipkart for the packaging and defect free device."

91,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
92,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

203,5,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.

Overall this device is value for money 💰..
Camera is good as compared to other brand (realme, mi, vivo) at this price range .

My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.

217,4,Worth the money,"Battery🔋 backup is pretty good, though fast changing isn't actually fast enough to charge this 6000 mah battery. Camera could have been far better for this 48 MP lense.

220,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

224,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
225,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming.

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
234,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
235,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

290,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
291,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
292,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .
Hope my review will be helpful 🙏🏻✨: )"
429,4,Pretty good,A best phone to buy. True samsung quality. Must buy. Speed was good and all features was awesome . But sound is very very poor. Sound -1/5.
430,4,Worth the money,"Awesome Deal!!

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

So don't think too much and if your budget is Under 12 k you can go for this because it's the best phone under this price range."

581,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
582,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.

707,4,Worth the money,"Battery🔋 backup is pretty good, though fast changing isn't actually fast enough to charge this 6000 mah battery. Camera could have been far better for this 48 MP lense.

I m totally impressed. Battery backup is great.
But it comes with many inbuilt apps, so it occupies around 10GB of storage..

710,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

714,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
715,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones 🎧 as it has dolby atmos feature."

724,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
725,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

And talking about the network, after the arrival of 5g, you will know how much speed it is giving, it is..."
772,3,Decent product,"Reasons for giving 3 stars, super night mode is not available in 4gb varient and this was not clearly mentioned, no 30w fast charging, drop notch display, these are the only cons i found. rest is good."
773,3,Good,"Good phn but camera not good as i expected

774,4,Very Good,"As usual we all known that Vivo is famous for their camera. If you look for good camera quality and space go for it. It looks is awsm 💁🏻‍♀️
Disadvantages :- screen touch 2/5 I rated bcz its not working properly and after installing apps its work more slower thn before 🥴"
775,5,Best in the market!,"Guys the camera quality of the phone is very good.

And even it best In segment for gaming.

Only macro camera is not good but camera quality is decent .

And even look of the phone is very pretty the design looks very nice. The phone is soo slim and light weight.
I have shared some photos clicked by vivo T1

The battery backup is also good But it should have atleast 33w charging speed but it has only 18w charging which is not soo fast."
776,1,Absolute rubbish!,"I bought 4gb varient mobile, touch screen wont work normally we have to press like 4-5 time to go back or to go home. Worst mobile, os works like very slow. Overall i give rating 1 that is more than enough. Vivo needs to work on this mobile asap."

970,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
971,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
972,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .
973,3,Good,"Product was good but camera is not satisfied for me.

1077,5,Must buy!,"This mobile is a beast.... wonderful mobile for daily use. Smooth and clear display. Camera is awesome,out door photography is really great, but the low light and indoor selfie should improve more, 90hz display is super and smooth. Speaker sound should improve more, the only lack in this mobile is it dosent have NFC and Back case not provided.. battery is awesome will last for 2 days.performance also great but not for heavy gaming."
1078,5,Wonderful,"I bought 4gb/64gb variant and that is superbly good.
1)Display will not disappoint you at all , Samoled with 90hz feels very smooth compared to that 120hz redmi note 10 pro.If you are a normal user then you will not find any difference between FHD+ and HD+ display ,so for me that is not a con.

1079,5,Best in the market!,Keeping in view the mid range level of entry samsung has made his presence felt within the masses. Camera and display are surprisingly good at this price range. Super amoled with hd well configured which is pleasing to the eye for long viewing. 64 gb storage which can be increased. Media tek helio 80 an old processor though does daily multitasking with ease.

When talk about camera ..i cant say very good but decent .."
1082,5,Brilliant,The best cheapest AMOLED phone available in indian market. Everything good but compared to MIUI Samsung UI is not that great. Rest Hardware wise all good. Better than Realme and Redmi devices
1083,5,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.

1090,2,Slightly disappointed,"Everything in this mobile is pretty good and android is lovely. A very bad experience from samsung. Network problem is really unacceptable. In the area where network is very high in this area it is saying out of network coverage area. At all, not happy with the performance of the mobile.

Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.

1097,4,Worth the money,"Battery🔋 backup is pretty good, though fast changing isn't actually fast enough to charge this 6000 mah battery. Camera could have been far better for this 48 MP lense. Phone performance is pretty good. Front camera 📷 is only average. Can opt this out if battery life and display quality only matters for some standard budget branded phone."
1098,5,Terrific,"Very nice phone, has awesome camera quality.
I m totally impressed. Battery backup is great.
But it comes with many inbuilt apps, so it occupies around 10GB of storage..
Overall nice mobile at this price range 👍"
1099,4,Worth the money,Using this phone for past 3months. No issues..camera is quite good. Macro photographers won't be disappointed. No heating issue. Charging takes around 2hrs. Display is quite crisp with bice viewing angles. Brightness is bit on lower side. Over all a trusted brand which provides good speed..ram ..everything. fully satisfied.
1100,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

1104,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
1105,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones 🎧 as it has dolby atmos feature."

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
1114,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
1115,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .
Hope my review will be helpful 🙏🏻✨: )"

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

So don't think too much and if your budget is Under 12 k you can go for this because it's the best phone under this price range."

1370,5,This game is fun,"It's fun even with only two people playing. This game can go on for hours. It all depends on how long you want to keep score.

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

1400,5,Excellent,"One of the best ways to have fun on off days, or with the intent to relax. Playing UNO does not take a lot of (mental) effort, unlike the more traditional Card games. The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules. So with a brief, 5 minute introduction, even a newbie will be ready for a game. Albeit it takes some time to master and figure out the techniques.

1470,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
1471,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
1472,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.

1600,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

1604,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
1605,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming.

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
1614,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
1615,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."
1616,4,Wonderful,"Good display, battery good, camera ok for price. but if u r claiming as 48 mp then came should be good. Flipkart packing should improve no bubble wrap? Overall good buy."
1617,5,Best in the market!,"Best class camera sensor , awesome display with super amoled, android 11and best performance."
1618,5,Terrific,"If you are planning on to buy a budget smartphone this can be one !! Though the display could be better .
But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .
Hope my review will be helpful 🙏🏻✨: )"
1619,4,Pretty good,A best phone to buy. True samsung quality. Must buy. Speed was good and all features was awesome . But sound is very very poor. Sound -1/5.
1620,4,Worth the money,"Awesome Deal!!

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

So don't think too much and if your budget is Under 12 k you can go for this because it's the best phone under this price range."

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

1890,5,Excellent,"One of the best ways to have fun on off days, or with the intent to relax. Playing UNO does not take a lot of (mental) effort, unlike the more traditional Card games. The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules. So with a brief, 5 minute introduction, even a newbie will be ready for a game. Albeit it takes some time to master and figure out the techniques.

2050,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
2051,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
2052,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .
2053,3,Good,"Product was good but camera is not satisfied for me.
Batter is good performance

2163,5,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.

My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.

2180,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

2184,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
2185,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming.

2194,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
2195,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.

2750,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
2751,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
2752,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.

2880,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

2884,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
2885,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming.

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
2894,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
2895,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .

3140,5,This game is fun,"It's fun even with only two people playing. This game can go on for hours. It all depends on how long you want to keep score.

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules.

3529,2,Slightly disappointed,Poor plastic quality n full of dust n all.
3530,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
3531,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
3532,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

3632,5,Brilliant,The best cheapest AMOLED phone available in indian market. Everything good but compared to MIUI Samsung UI is not that great. Rest Hardware wise all good. Better than Realme and Redmi devices
3633,5,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.

than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.

3650,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

3654,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
3655,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming.

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
3664,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
3665,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

3679,5,Terrific purchase,I recently purchased this Samsung Galaxy F22 from flipkart. This is the best value for money smartphone with best specification priced very agressively.

3683,4,Delightful,"Great specs at great prices. Only complain: lot of bloatware; and you're not allowed to uninstall a lot of them. There are 2 Messages app, one from Google and another from Samsung and you can uninstall nither. Although 2 major Android updates are promised, the phone runs on Android 11, with security patch from May (this is August 3). Other than that, decent camera, good battery life that gets charged pretty quick with in-box charger, good vibrant screen and smooth performance with Helio G80 (..."

4420,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
4421,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
4422,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

4517,5,Must buy!,"This mobile is a beast.... wonderful mobile for daily use. Smooth and clear display. Camera is awesome,out door photography is really great, but the low light and indoor selfie should improve more, 90hz display is super and smooth.

My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.

4538,5,Terrific,"Very nice phone, has awesome camera quality.

4540,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

4544,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
4545,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones 🎧 as it has dolby atmos feature."

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
4554,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
4555,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

4810,5,This game is fun,"It's fun even with only two people playing. This game can go on for hours. It all depends on how long you want to keep score.

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

4840,5,Excellent,"One of the best ways to have fun on off days, or with the intent to relax. Playing UNO does not take a lot of (mental) effort, unlike the more traditional Card games. The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules. So with a brief, 5 minute introduction, even a newbie will be ready for a game. Albeit it takes some time to master and figure out the techniques.

5401,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
5402,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

5507,5,Must buy!,"This mobile is a beast.... wonderful mobile for daily use. Smooth and clear display. Camera is awesome,out door photography is really great, but the low light and indoor selfie should improve more, 90hz display is super and smooth.

5512,5,Brilliant,The best cheapest AMOLED phone available in indian market. Everything good but compared to MIUI Samsung UI is not that great. Rest Hardware wise all good. Better than Realme and Redmi devices
5513,5,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.

My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.

5530,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

5534,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
5535,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones 🎧 as it has dolby atmos feature."

5544,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
5545,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

5790,5,This game is fun,"It's fun even with only two people playing. This game can go on for hours. It all depends on how long you want to keep score.

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

5820,5,Excellent,"One of the best ways to have fun on off days, or with the intent to relax. Playing UNO does not take a lot of (mental) effort, unlike the more traditional Card games. The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules. So with a brief, 5 minute introduction, even a newbie will be ready for a game. Albeit it takes some time to master and figure out the techniques.

6490,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
6491,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn’t true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don’t go for it
6492,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.

6610,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

6614,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
6615,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones 🎧 as it has dolby atmos feature."

6624,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
6625,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.

1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.

4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me).

384,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components

USB Flash Drive is so good This product is value for money and id high speed data Transfer support and Flipkart give 5 Year warranty for any issues all costumer plz buy this product and carry your Documents . i love Flipkart"
571,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!😍"
572,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
573,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
574,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
575,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! 😍👍"
576,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
577,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
578,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
579,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
580,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
581,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
582,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
583,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
584,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

674,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

3. The senser is not that good, as it take many touches to see temperature.

I purchased it for Rs. 281, Not worthy at all."

1 it doesn't keep water cool for even 30 minute
2 paint doesn't last for more than 15 days
3 water start smelling after 1 hour
and last thing is that I don't think that water indicator would be accurate...give money to poors rather buying it..."

It does neither the function of flask nor the temperature reading.

961,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!😍"
962,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
963,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
964,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
965,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! 😍👍"
966,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
967,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
968,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
969,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
970,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
971,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
972,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
973,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
974,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

1054,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."
1055,5,Great product,this is a fabulous item must to Buy transparent capacity is a very good and very high profiles of better product must buy from Flipkart it is the wonderful item

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
1147,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.

1149,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

I prefer it's best one."
1151,4,Awesome,The product is good for daily usage. If u are one who needs to write and delete a huge amount of data everyday then go for a usb 3.0 its average writing speed is 6-8mbps and read speed is 72 mbps(as per my observation) well using it for a year and no issues at all......hit like if u liked the review..

1157,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

I loved it!!😍"
1442,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

1443,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
1444,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."

so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! 😍👍"
1446,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
1447,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
1448,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
1449,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
1450,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
1451,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
1452,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
1453,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
1454,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

1636,5,Simply awesome,"Amazing Pendrive, I ordered 32 GB but received 64GB.
So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
1637,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.
1638,4,Worth the money,Trust product and storage nearly 28.8GB
1639,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0
You should go for usb 3.0 for better performance especially in 2021."

I prefer it's best one."
1641,4,Awesome,The product is good for daily usage. If u are one who needs to write and delete a huge amount of data everyday then go for a usb 3.0 its average writing speed is 6-8mbps and read speed is 72 mbps(as per my observation) well using it for a year and no issues at all......hit like if u liked the review..

1645,5,Great product,"I Love the product very nice and good working,
I didn't think the storage in 32gb pendrive of 31full gb so nice"
1646,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
1647,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

1931,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!😍"
1932,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
1933,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
1934,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
1935,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! 😍👍"
1936,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
1937,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
1938,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
1939,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
1940,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
1941,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
1942,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
1943,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
1944,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

2034,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
2127,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.

2129,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

I prefer it's best one."

2137,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

2431,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!😍"
2432,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

2433,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
2434,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
2435,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! 😍👍"
2436,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
2437,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
2438,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
2439,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
2440,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
2441,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
2442,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
2443,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
2444,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
2627,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.
2628,4,Worth the money,Trust product and storage nearly 28.8GB
2629,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

I prefer it's best one."

2635,5,Great product,"I Love the product very nice and good working,
I didn't think the storage in 32gb pendrive of 31full gb so nice"
2636,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
2637,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me).

at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
3019,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
3020,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
3021,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
3022,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
3023,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
3024,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

3114,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
3207,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.

3209,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

3217,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

3616,5,Brilliant,"Boult is better than JBL, SONY, SKULLCANDY etc. but this product(Boult Bassbuds X1) is even better than its own two earphones i.e. Boult Bassbuds Oak and Boult Bassbuds Strom (I have used)... better in sound clarity from these two....

But, one thing is its wire is thinner than others, let's see how much time it survives...."

If you are lover of music you can blindly purchase this earphone they dont pain in you ear if you are play music a long time . I purchase this in 299rs and in this price range this is best earphone"

Also thanks to flipkart for early delivery."
3621,1,Unsatisfactory,"My mic got not working after 10days of purchase,, and sound quality is not good as given in description.
You ears will get pain after countinous usage of 20-30 minutes,, Not suitable for music lover's
Sound is only for half volume,, higher volume doesn't support these earphones good
. At last I Am not satisfied with this product much since,
sound quality is not good And MIC is not working after few days 🥺🥴"

3623,5,Wonderful,Nice deal to get on. I got it around 334 using supercoins. Earlier I was using mi basic earphones. Compared to those this this tge same with bass and a extra addon of treble which is balanced very nicely. You can hear the crisp sounds as well by setting eqalizer. I had also used leaf wireless earphones which was nice. I believe no earphones lasts more than 8 months. So ultimately u have to change it. So I tried this cheap ones but they are really good. You can go for it.
3624,4,Wonderful,good enough ...sound quality is not that good but it's okay ...mic also works perfectly

Sound quality is good but for low to medium volume music.
It's design is fantastic...

But, I advise the buyer to first try and confirm your size S or M or L before continue using for long time. So, it may prevent pain.

It's an good one, referring to its price and comparing it to other quality products.

And after all it's an China originated company, so choice is yours."
3638,5,Simply awesome,"The headphones are really nice. I didn't expecedt such good quality sound from these headphones. Till now I've used only branded headphones from companies like JBL, Sony, Sennheiser etc. This was first time I tried these headphones. I must admit I am impressed with the sound quality. It has good thumping bass. Wish it had L shaped audio jack as it's useful during gaming but it's at slightly tapered angle which is quite unique.

Con: The volume adjuster is not present on buttons panel. The wire is quite thin and somewhat fragile, might need extra care.

3669,4,Pretty good,The head phones ar too good the sound the bass is beyond expected .... I never thought that this headphones wil be so good in this affordable price
3670,4,Very Good,Bass is bit muddy but you can feel the beat on it. Sound separation i.e instruments separation is not great . Vocal are clear but at high volume it kighy be uncomfortable. Sound doesnt feel that it is in the center in your head it always in the periferi and its not good thing while enjoying music.

3711,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!😍"
3712,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

3713,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
3714,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
3715,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! 😍👍"
3716,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
3717,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
3718,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
3719,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
3720,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
3721,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
3722,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
3723,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
3724,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

3906,5,Simply awesome,"Amazing Pendrive, I ordered 32 GB but received 64GB.
So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
3907,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.
3908,4,Worth the money,Trust product and storage nearly 28.8GB
3909,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

I prefer it's best one."
3911,4,Awesome,The product is good for daily usage. If u are one who needs to write and delete a huge amount of data everyday then go for a usb 3.0 its average writing speed is 6-8mbps and read speed is 72 mbps(as per my observation) well using it for a year and no issues at all......hit like if u liked the review..

3915,5,Great product,"I Love the product very nice and good working,
I didn't think the storage in 32gb pendrive of 31full gb so nice"
3916,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
3917,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

4303,5,Wonderful,Nice deal to get on. I got it around 334 using supercoins. Earlier I was using mi basic earphones. Compared to those this this tge same with bass and a extra addon of treble which is balanced very nicely. You can hear the crisp sounds as well by setting eqalizer. I had also used leaf wireless earphones which was nice. I believe no earphones lasts more than 8 months. So ultimately u have to change it. So I tried this cheap ones but they are really good. You can go for it.

Sound quality is good but for low to medium volume music.
It's design is fantastic...

But, I advise the buyer to first try and confirm your size S or M or L before continue using for long time. So, it may prevent pain.

It's an good one, referring to its price and comparing it to other quality products.

And after all it's an China originated company, so choice is yours."
4318,5,Simply awesome,"The headphones are really nice. I didn't expecedt such good quality sound from these headphones. Till now I've used only branded headphones from companies like JBL, Sony, Sennheiser etc. This was first time I tried these headphones. I must admit I am impressed with the sound quality. It has good thumping bass. Wish it had L shaped audio jack as it's useful during gaming but it's at slightly tapered angle which is quite unique. I wanted red one but it wasn't available so settled for black. It'..."

4331,5,Wonderful,"Pros: At a price around 350/400, this is an excellent buy. The bass is not too punchy or echoing and the Treble is also equally great. Great sound quality over voice/video calls as well and also the mic is great. No discomfort on ears and fits perfectly.


Con: The volume adjuster is not present on buttons panel. The wire is quite thin and somewhat fragile, might need extra care.

4350,4,Very Good,Bass is bit muddy but you can feel the beat on it. Sound separation i.e instruments separation is not great . Vocal are clear but at high volume it kighy be uncomfortable. Sound doesnt feel that it is in the center in your head it always in the periferi and its not good thing while enjoying music.

4392,5,Must buy!,I really like the quality of case. Its compact and easy to carry. The sound is very deep and clear. Amazing audio qualitya and deep bass. C type slot and cable with fast charging. A complete full package with minimum cost. Worth buying this.
4393,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
4394,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."
4395,5,Excellent,"Great quality thanks for this i can't believe how impressive is this audio bass trebles is great good quality,i recommend to all buyers to buy with without any queries thinking about this .Thanks for this 😍😍😌😌😌"

GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS IN THIS PRICE RANGE....👏"
4426,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It is the best tws in this price range. Ergonomic design is absolutely perfect, it doesn't fall even while riding a bike. Touch controls are also smooth. On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

4435,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"

Don't know what to do with this earbuds now.
There is also no replacement for the same.

4479,5,Terrific,"Nice product
I just love it please buy.
Value for money"
4480,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
4481,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
4482,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
4483,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
4484,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

4574,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

4666,5,Simply awesome,"Amazing Pendrive, I ordered 32 GB but received 64GB.
So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
4667,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.
4668,4,Worth the money,Trust product and storage nearly 28.8GB
4669,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

I prefer it's best one."

4675,5,Great product,"I Love the product very nice and good working,
I didn't think the storage in 32gb pendrive of 31full gb so nice"
4676,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
4677,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

If you are lover of music you can blindly purchase this earphone they dont pain in you ear if you are play music a long time . I purchase this in 299rs and in this price range this is best earphone"
5080,5,Great product,"Just go for it!! Won't get better at this price. At par with boat bassheads 225. The bass impressed me so much, well balanced sound. It's comforting as well.
Also thanks to flipkart for early delivery."
5081,1,Unsatisfactory,"My mic got not working after 10days of purchase,, and sound quality is not good as given in description.
You ears will get pain after countinous usage of 20-30 minutes,, Not suitable for music lover's
Sound is only for half volume,, higher volume doesn't support these earphones good
. At last I Am not satisfied with this product much since,
sound quality is not good And MIC is not working after few days 🥺🥴"
5082,5,Best in the market!,This is bestest earphone in my life build quality is superb and Sound superb👌 Bass I can't explain 👌👌 over all this is best earphone if you are finding earphone for then I recommend this once again thank you so much for this amazing product
5083,5,Wonderful,Nice deal to get on. I got it around 334 using supercoins. Earlier I was using mi basic earphones. Compared to those this this tge same with bass and a extra addon of treble which is balanced very nicely. You can hear the crisp sounds as well by setting eqalizer. I had also used leaf wireless earphones which was nice. I believe no earphones lasts more than 8 months. So ultimately u have to change it. So I tried this cheap ones but they are really good. You can go for it.
5084,4,Wonderful,good enough ...sound quality is not that good but it's okay ...mic also works perfectly

But, I advise the buyer to first try and confirm your size S or M or L before continue using for long time. So, it may prevent pain.

It's an good one, referring to its price and comparing it to other quality products.

And after all it's an China originated company, so choice is yours."
5098,5,Simply awesome,"The headphones are really nice. I didn't expecedt such good quality sound from these headphones. Till now I've used only branded headphones from companies like JBL, Sony, Sennheiser etc. This was first time I tried these headphones. I must admit I am impressed with the sound quality.

Con: The volume adjuster is not present on buttons panel. The wire is quite thin and somewhat fragile, might need extra care.

5130,4,Very Good,Bass is bit muddy but you can feel the beat on it. Sound separation i.e instruments separation is not great . Vocal are clear but at high volume it kighy be uncomfortable. Sound doesnt feel that it is in the center in your head it always in the periferi and its not good thing while enjoying music.

5173,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
5174,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."

On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

5205,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"

5260,4,Nice product,"Pros,
1. Good neckband at a decent price
2. Bass is more than average if you want thumping bass then download ""Subwoofer bass"" App then use it with neckband, it would be killer...
3.Metallic body.
Cons,
1. Wire is short but that is fine enough.
2. Magnet is not so strong yet it can attract the earbuds.
3. Battery backup is of 2 hours of continuos music and 3 hours for call.
Conclusion:-
If your budget is not enough for buying a branded neckband then go out this. It is good enough than ..."
5261,5,Perfect product!,This earphone is best for some works because its voice is best and build is good and its best for student online class
5262,3,Does the job,"It's ok for the price. The build quality is actually better than what I expected. Both of the sides have magnets but it's not very strong. Speaking of sound quality, it's good for calls but not good for music. If you are buying this earphone for music purposes then I recommend use an equaliser or a bass booster. I tested the earphones and I barely got 2 hours of battery. The microphone works great and it's good for online classes. The charging time is 2.5 hours but it depends on what kind of ..."

5361,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!😍"
5362,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
5363,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
5364,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
5365,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! 😍👍"
5366,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
5367,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
5368,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
5369,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
5370,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
5371,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
5372,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
5373,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
5374,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

5454,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

5546,5,Simply awesome,"Amazing Pendrive, I ordered 32 GB but received 64GB.
So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
5547,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.
5548,4,Worth the money,Trust product and storage nearly 28.8GB
5549,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0
You should go for usb 3.0 for better performance especially in 2021."

I prefer it's best one."
5551,4,Awesome,The product is good for daily usage. If u are one who needs to write and delete a huge amount of data everyday then go for a usb 3.0 its average writing speed is 6-8mbps and read speed is 72 mbps(as per my observation) well using it for a year and no issues at all......hit like if u liked the review..

5555,5,Great product,"I Love the product very nice and good working,
I didn't think the storage in 32gb pendrive of 31full gb so nice"
5556,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
5557,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

You ears will get pain after countinous usage of 20-30 minutes,, Not suitable for music lover's

. At last I Am not satisfied with this product much since,
sound quality is not good And MIC is not working after few days 🥺🥴"

5963,5,Wonderful,Nice deal to get on. I got it around 334 using supercoins. Earlier I was using mi basic earphones. Compared to those this this tge same with bass and a extra addon of treble which is balanced very nicely. You can hear the crisp sounds as well by setting eqalizer. I had also used leaf wireless earphones which was nice. I believe no earphones lasts more than 8 months. So ultimately u have to change it. So I tried this cheap ones but they are really good. You can go for it.

Sound doesnt feel that it is in the center in your head it always in the periferi and its not good thing while enjoying music.

6050,5,Brilliant,It is very good product in the price range. And it looks like apple Air pods. Very cool design and awesome product. The sound is good and build is strong. I say go for it better than any other.
6051,5,Best in the market!,"Finally every feature that i want merged to one single brand. Happy with bass, treble, crystal clear sound, perfect for calling, very comfortable to ears, decent look, best battery backup, build quality excellent. Everything is perfect."
6052,5,Must buy!,I really like the quality of case. Its compact and easy to carry. The sound is very deep and clear. Amazing audio qualitya and deep bass. C type slot and cable with fast charging. A complete full package with minimum cost. Worth buying this.
6053,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
6054,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."
6055,5,Excellent,"Great quality thanks for this i can't believe how impressive is this audio bass trebles is great good quality,i recommend to all buyers to buy with without any queries thinking about this .Thanks for this 😍😍😌😌😌"

6067,4,Really Nice,"Worth accordingly price. If you are taking for fashion and design, they are amazing. And if you are taking for listening only then you can purchase something more better than this. But nevertheless they are also good in volume and bass. It’s and average product in listening and best in design. And battery backup is too good."

7.Supports fast charging (Around 1hr 5 minutes in my case)...
8.It has type c port...
Cons:
1.Build quality of case is not good but u can say average..
GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS IN THIS PRICE RANGE....👏"
6086,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It is the best tws in this price range. Ergonomic design is absolutely perfect, it doesn't fall even while riding a bike. Touch controls are also smooth. On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

6094,5,Just wow!,Boult company is best and bass is good money is less thank you Flifkart
6095,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"

Cons,
1. Wire is short but that is fine enough.
2. Magnet is not so strong yet it can attract the earbuds.

Speaking of sound quality, it's good for calls but not good for music. If you are buying this earphone for music purposes then I recommend use an equaliser or a bass booster.
