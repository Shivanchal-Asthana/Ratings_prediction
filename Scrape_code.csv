542,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

842,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

915,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
921,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

924,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
925,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
926,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use

932,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
933,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
934,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
935,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

961,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

1242,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

1315,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
1321,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
1325,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use

Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
1333,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
1334,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
1335,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
1336,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I‚Äôm loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

1476,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.

1721,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

1800,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
1813,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural.

Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I‚Äôm not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

2443,4,Go for it without any hesitation.,"Honest advice : Don't watch any tech reviewer's videos before buying this beast.

I purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :

1. Device looks small but the way it works is truly amazing.
2. if you are switching from ~6"" screen , it is going to be troublesome for a while.

2444,4,Pretty good,"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

2448,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok.

2821,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
2890,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far

Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
2902,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
2903,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
2904,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

3041,4,Pretty good,The phone is amazing according to me.. just some cons r the battery life and the big bezels .. the small phone is all I needed .. and it feels so much secure in one hand.. i needed exactly this type of phone which i can use one handed and have the beast like performance.. previously i was using a 5 inch phone Nokia 3 so the shift according to size is giving the same feel.. one thing that bothering me is the keyboard‚Ä¶ even its approx the same size phone but keyboard is too tight to type.. it w...

1) Superb build quality

3043,5,Fabulous!,"Best iPhone in this price range.It can do almost everything an iPhone 11 can do and will get long support for iOS updates.Battery life is very good very few people know how to optimise the iOS according to their needs for battery usage. So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11."
3044,5,Perfecto !,"1 Week after using the phone I am Simply Loving it!
I did a lot of research and was confused in Iphone XR, SE 2020 and One plus 8

If you are Ok with older design/big bezels or looking for GREAT Camera in budget phone or moving from Android to IOS, this phone is best for you.
Camera(Portrait in selfie mode), Build quality, A13 Bionic Chip, Compact design, latest OS(software support for at least 4 years) is simply Bang On!

Downs :
Night mode Camera quality is not good.
Battery is not the best..."
3045,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.
If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."
3046,4,Good quality product,"First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It‚Äôs been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions.
Pros:
Fits in the budget.
Handy device.
Camera and display are awesome.
Good network connectivity.
Latest iOS update.
Great build quality ( its glass back so be carefull )

3048,4,Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
3049,4,Really Nice,"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11."
3050,5,Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel.

3053,5,Terrific,"I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :

iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s ,
So when time came to change, I had to chose between iphone11 and iphone SE2020.

Now I chose SE2020 and I am happy with the purchase.

Main reason for choosing SE2020 was the latest CPU and fingerprint scanner.
I am not comfortable with Face ID .

I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

3564,4,Pretty good,"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

3568,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok.

Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily.

3583,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
3589,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don‚Äôt like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

Battery is pretty good for normal use I you and not fond of watching Videos and play games it last for 1.5 days with some gaming and video its manage to last a day.
Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
4010,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone. I didn't go for the 12 Pro max as it is ginormous in size and the 12 mini was reviewed to have sub par battery life. 12 and 12 Pro are the ideal phones for the best of both worlds. I didnt need the telephoto and Lidar camera, so I went with 12 to save some thousands. I'm enjoying the single hande..."

4013,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
4014,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
4015,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use
3. Screen brightness is better than iPhone X

Not mentioning about other aspects like performance , speed as they already are close to perfect.

Battery - not more than one complete day after constant usage of WhatsApp, safari, emails, spotify music & youtube videos"

4021,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
4022,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
4023,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
4024,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
4025,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I‚Äôm loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

4050,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

I‚Äôm not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That‚Äôs why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

The phone works flawlessly, with great audio and a decent speaker, for voice or music. The text feature, likewise, is extremely easy to use and intuitive.

Mow coming to the device and specifically to its camera, its over hyped according to me!
I have watched a lot of reviews and all those sweet things about camera and pic quality but there are some caveats.

4632,5,Awesome,"I have been using iPhone 12 from past 10 days. Overall a great phone with best battery life, best camera and great display. The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It‚Äôs top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
4633,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

4713,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

4718,5,Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
4719,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don‚Äôt like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."

5081,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
5160,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far

A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
5173,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.

It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars.

Good product."
5438,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
5449,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left.

5451,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
5452,5,Perfect product!,awesome in ear design. comfortable to wear. high bass. good trumph. budget friendly. I suggest you if you could afford then buy a pouch too for extra protection.‚ù§
5453,5,Must buy!,"This is best handsfree for gaming and listing song. I also play pubg india and other games it's best for all. It has 3D voice system.
So this is best for gaming."
5454,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
5455,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.

Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.
Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain."

5461,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
5462,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
5463,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
5464,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."

But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.

5467,4,Value-for-money,"So after a lot of confusion ended up with senhinser cx213, 1more piston fit, jbl t110 & realme buds 2
Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.
Few things I would like be get added..."
5468,5,Classy product,The Sound quality is superb and the base quality is also good ..The point thing which I liked in this earphone is that its durability ..the wire quality is good ..before I was using the sennheiser cx275 ..the wire got cut from middle ..I am happy with this earphones.
5469,4,Wonderful,"This earphone is truly worth it's price i.e. 500. Got it 2 days ago and using it since then. Sound quality is awsm and bass too. The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
5470,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

This is my second pair of these earp..."
5471,4,Value-for-money,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume. But I know most of average Indians who are looking for a budget earphone will most certainly lov..."

5479,5,Terrific,"The quality of the earphone is very good it may comepete with the earphones which are about 1500 rs to 2000 rs the bass and treble are so nice but due to bass the vocals may affected a little but in your day to day usage you don't feel but those who are bass lovers like me the absolutely prefer this earphone

I am happy with quality. No distortion of sound at any point. Bass and treble perfect balance. You will really not getting any outer noise after plug-in it in ear. Feel like sennheiser quality in low price."
5492,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."
5493,5,Just wow!,"Writing this review after a year of using this

Realme released Buds 2 Neo which is 100 cheaper than this but go for Buds 2 instead of Neo and Buds 2 has more premium and sturdy cable.

I tried different types of wired earphones in the past under 1k price range including boat, sony, jbl etc but none of them lasted more than 6 months for my usage, but the best budget earphones for me is Redmi Basic which is under 399 but they are not available since 1 year so I had to buy Realme buds 2 which ..."

The primary rear camera has a 13-megapixel resolution, compared to 12 megapixels on its two siblings.

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I‚Äôm not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That‚Äôs why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

5870,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

The most important thing about this phone is the performance. It‚Äôs top notch. A14 Bionic chip which is 5mm SOC with 5G modem delivers a greater performance without any lag. With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
5883,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

5947,5,Best in the market!,"It is just so beautiful and I think you should buy it, the camera is a beast, the battery last just fine through out the day with mild use, if ur a heavy user you'd need to charge it maybe but the performance is epic and you get rlly good gameplay, worth the money, btw if ur coming for a larger screen, you might feel it's a lil too small but honestly it's not rlly that small, so buy it, it's perfect."
5948,4,Value-for-money,"Battery will give good performance for a normal user
I suggest another variant for heavy users
Cam quality is good in day light conditions
Performance is very good with A13 Bionic chip
Small in size and don‚Äôt expect a screen size like MI or one plus full screen mobiles"
5949,5,Highly recommended,"Each and every Paisa you is worthy
Camera section is a great upgrade
Performance is a beast
It‚Äôs just a old design but still amazing design to hold in hand.
I upgraded from old SE and satisfied to the core"
5950,5,Brilliant,So fast as light classy premium look at affordable price thank you flipkart for easy delivery
5951,5,Highly recommended,"Loved it!
12 MP single camera does its job better than many flagship camera phones. Very compact and perfect for single hand use. Battery lasts at least one day for a normal use."
5952,5,Must buy!,"Best camera phone
Image processing is best
Best display and battery life is also best
Best processor
Overall best phone
U can look after images also"
5953,4,Nice product,"It‚Äôs a beast in performance, only thing that I didn‚Äôt like is it lacks night mode for low light photography. Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily. Doesn‚Äôt break a sweat no matter what you throw at it, whether a heavy gameplay or exporting/rendering of heavy videos. Fits perfectly in pocket as well as in hand. I‚Äôve been using it for more than 9 months. It is really a great device if..."
5954,5,Perfect product!,"Speed is Awesome , high quality Camera with portrait mode , more handy than big screen mobiles, Premium look & design , sound quality is boom , very happy After purchase this"
5955,5,Perfect product!,"This Phone is Simply Brilliant.The fastest mobile processor from Apple, A13 bionic chip can tackle any task without breaking a sweat. The CLASSIC Design is the reason to buy this phone as it is so easy for one hand operation. Camera performance and Battery backup has been improved significantly over the predecessor. Definetely a Value for your Buck."
5956,5,Worth every penny,Best model if you wish to enter the Apple ecosystem. Flawless product and seamless experience. I love this phone.
5957,5,Best in the market!,"Hey iPhone lovers. If you like small phone you'll love it. A13 performed like a beast. Performance is top notch. If your budget tight, then go for it. You never disappoint after use it. And Apple iPhone security is best."
5958,1,Terrible product,It‚Äôs not good product ...it‚Äôs cost is more quality is not good every time is hangout..battery consumption is more at least half day also not get in ...finally my best suggestion is choose another one...
5959,5,Terrific purchase,Excellent phone from Apple... Almost same like iPhone 7 and 8 with latest processor. I can feel the speed very much compared to the iPhone 6s. It‚Äôs awesome budget phone from iPhone family.
5960,5,Simply awesome,It's a good phone for who like handy phones. But when its come to battery backup it's a worst thing. Performance of the phone is good
5961,4,Wonderful,"Performance is top notch, battery is full day easily after disabling background app Refresh ( it doesn‚Äôt effect any functionality) and some other tweaks. Camera is fantastic overall value for money if you get this in offer."
5962,4,Very Good,"Amazing phone, loved it, only issue is gets hot too much and too early. Otherwise a very good buy"
5963,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."
5964,5,Brilliant,"For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean top notch performance ......
FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY
This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch

. Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing

5965,5,Great product,"Excellent phone , flawless performance
The massive upgrade for the user who are using the iphone SE ( 1 gen) just like me"
5966,4,Wonderful,"Well, the phone is small and looks nice. It's not for people who loves bigger ones. It's basically for those people who don't use their phones for everything.
It's fast.
design is cool, sleek and beautiful. You will need a back cover for sure if you want to keep up it's beauty. P:)
battery life - not so good.
voice clarity is fine.
I am not a gamer neither a photographer.

Basically it;s a premium phone under budget so that you can say it loud - "" Hey! I own an Apple device"". If somebody is ..."
5967,5,Wonderful,"Like It, Apple SE very nice and handy mobile, we can use it by single hand, like it too much if you are going single handy mobile you can go with Apple SE 2020 without any hesitation."
5968,5,Brilliant,"Very handy and comfortable to hold. Best phone to buy if you want sleek design, powerfull processor, beautiful camera and that's fits in your pocket. I didn't hesitate while buying this phone instead of oneplus 8. Afterall its your choice whether you want a phone or a tab sized phone.
P.S.- it's not that small."
5969,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect. People who don‚Äôt like to carry big handsets on pocket can definitely go for this. But remember if you play more games or if u r always on internet you might need to carry a fast charger."
5970,5,Good phone for the price,"Some might say overpriced in India, but below are the PROS and CONS after 3 days of usage:

I am a big fan of iOS and I‚Äôm deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad, MacBook, AirPods and an old iPod and I‚Äôm not disappointed here too.

5975,5,Great product,Honestly best package from apple. Super handy. I don't like big phones. This phone is perfect for me and would definately recommend to everybody. If you compare antutu and geekbench scores with of iphone 11; this easily beats the iphone 11.

5983,5,Fabulous!,"Best iPhone in this price range.It can do almost everything an iPhone 11 can do and will get long support for iOS updates.Battery life is very good very few people know how to optimise the iOS according to their needs for battery usage. So I get easily a day of use, many people say heavy usage consumes battery life that's true for any smartphone even iPhone 11."
5984,5,Perfecto !,"1 Week after using the phone I am Simply Loving it!
I did a lot of research and was confused in Iphone XR, SE 2020 and One plus 8

If you are Ok with older design/big bezels or looking for GREAT Camera in budget phone or moving from Android to IOS, this phone is best for you.

5985,5,Great product,"Amazing Performance. If you are upgrading from an android, don't expect the battery life to be better. But if you upgrading from an Iphone 6, 7 or maybe 8, you will feel the difference. You can experience the speed with the A13 Bionic Chip. Camera Quality has improved. The best part is it's price. In this price you are getting a compact Iphone 11 Pro.
If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."
5986,4,Good quality product,"First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It‚Äôs been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions.

5988,4,Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
5989,4,Really Nice,"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11."
5990,5,Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel.

iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s ,
So when time came to change, I had to chose between iphone11 and iphone SE2020.

Now I chose SE2020 and I am happy with the purchase.

Main reason for choosing SE2020 was the latest CPU and fingerprint scanner.

6089,5,Brilliant,"It's a interesting product so I'm writing this after 24 hours of burn out.. so stay tuned to know the full story.. eartips are silicone tips very comfortable but doesn't stay in my ear much well, but your mileage may vary.. build is great but after receiving my item I noticed scuffs and nylons coming off a little from the part near 3.5 mm port.. otherwise it's built really well.. speakers for calls is tremendous easily putting mi basics to shame.. it's great for people like me who talks a lot..."
6090,5,Great product,"Sound quality is really good... Better than boat bass 200,225.. i have used many earphones like JBL , Skullcandy,boat,bout,leaf,bose,sony etc.. but i fell this is also good as leaf bolt ... I love itüòç.."

Its looks are also cool to see with yellow lines. The button of the remote are tactile and easy to use and differentiate. The sound goes to extreme volume no trouble after long hours of use.
6092,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."
6093,1,Worthless,"After using 3 months, having mike issues. When you are playing songs it's good but when you are on call it's not a worthy enough"
6094,2,Bad quality,"seriously abnormal bass guys...which is a big. negative about this earpiece ... ..i dont know why nobody paid attention to this bass boost feature , which is annoying. ...you will never be able to listen to the originally recorded song ....but will hear abnormal extreme bass in every song you play ..which may not be pleasing ....and you want to turn off the feature ...but you can not coz it is a default feature in this earpiece...sound clarity is good ..build also good ....

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
6118,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

6128,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
6129,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left.

6131,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.

So this is best for gaming."
6134,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
6135,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.

6141,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
6142,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."

Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
6144,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."

6150,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

6190,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
6191,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."
6192,1,Absolute rubbish! VERY BAD for CALLING,"If you buying this earphone for CALLING don't buy this. I received earphone and i try this. For calling it creating extra distortion in voice. If you buying for MUSIC then good earphone. I return the earphone and after return i got new earphone then again same problem. i already have Boat 100 hawk design that earphone good for calling. I STRONGLY RECOMMENDED DON'T BUY boat 242 for whatsapp or any other internet calling .

Every single minute detailed sound you can listen on this earphone and for playing PUBG.
6195,4,Delightful,"Compared it with Sennheiser cx180. Bass is smooth in this set but Sennheiser has high treble with boom bass.

Pros:

6210,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes . Boat should have provided more ear hooks of different sizes so it could be comfortable for everyone if you have normal or big sized ears , this product will be perfect for you the sound quality is very good, built quality is very good wire length is perfect . This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for me

6233,3,Decent product,"Good design and sound quality (although I am not a fan of bass headphones). I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great. Lots of issues like sound loop, echoes, other person unable to hear loud and clear if the wires are hanging (like in normal cases). If you bring the mic close to the mouth, only then you are properly audible + echoes are there no matter what. So, all in all it is good for those who likes bass headphones, but don't r..."

The performance is great worth money but one thing lacks is the build of 2 rubber like support near the earphones it got loosed and streched within a week too poor quality rubber user whereas the wire are little thick and good that's comfortable. The only thing I am not satisfied with the product is the the rubbers near the ear too poor quality rubbers used overall performance is great good for gaming......

6235,4,Nice product,The perfect wired headset at the lowest price. The sound quality is brilliant and it is perfectly fit.

6239,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
6240,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
6241,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
6242,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"

In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."

6531,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

6604,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
6610,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

There are no powerful android phones which are compact to use single handedly..that's the main reason I'm living the iPhone.

6613,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
6614,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
6615,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use

Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
6622,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
6623,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
6624,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
6625,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I‚Äôm loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance.

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

6650,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

6699,4,Nice product,"Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years, with a decent camera, waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage.

There's a few things it could've done better:

1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.
2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.

If you are looking to own an Iphone, you should 100% go for this."
6766,4,Good quality product,"First of all let me tell you I am an Android user from years and still love it. The purpose to buy an iPhone was to switch for a new eco system and to experience it. It‚Äôs been only 4 days of using this device and here are my initial impressions.
Pros:
Fits in the budget.
Handy device.
Camera and display are awesome.
Good network connectivity.
Latest iOS update.
Great build quality ( its glass back so be carefull )
Performance is great.

And yes it‚Äôs an iPhone!

6767,5,Simply awesome,"Breathtaking. Smooth Performance. Amazing Camera and video performance. Dual Sim. Smooth Networks. Ideal for first time Android users, who are doing the switch. Battery Backup is decent. Will last for a day, for a moderate user. Buy it for the A13 Bionic. You won't regret."
6768,4,Really Nice,"Good for normal use like browsing and not recommended for gaming because of small screen size,overall a good product from apple."
6769,4,Really Nice,"It's easy to hold, looks good but slippery one. Performance is good. Battery is below average. If you turn off mobile data and use wifi then battery goes little more time. Back camera good in day light only. Front camera just ok ok. Someone who only use for mail, chat then its ok. Better go for iphone 11."
6770,5,Great product,"Firstly you all need to understand there is a crowd in this Huge Market for whom the ONLY THING WHICH MATTERS IS COMPACT SIZE. And probably phone companies are unable to understand this consumer behaviour. This market was not catered by any other company except to an extent by Google Pixel. Please remember each and every consumer who buys this phone is buying Primarily for its compact size. The dimensions are amazing, which overrides any other shortfall of the device such as battery, Screen s..."
6771,5,Super!,"First of all thank u apple for making such good phone.
Guys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.
Camera is too good in light, I mean best, but don‚Äôt expect great pics in night.
Battery life is good according to size and display of phone, keep one fast charger with u and forget about battery issue because there is no issue with battery if u are not a hardcore gamer. It gives u full day with battery with moderate use. Charging in 30 minutes with 12 watt charger is 50 to 60%. I guess v..."
6772,5,Classy product,It is a very good device. You will feel how premium is it whenever you hold in your hand. It is very nice to hold. And size is just perfect! Above all it has the best camera. See the attached picture which I clicked in the evening.You should go for the red one!
6773,5,Terrific,"I have been an android user since the beginning! I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition! I was very skeptical by some bad reviews on internet, but to my very frank opinion it exceeded my expectations! Some things to keep in mind :
*This phone has not so big display and only supports upto 720p videos on YouTube, so if you watch YouTube all day and love big screens it‚Äôs not th..."

6776,5,Terrific purchase,"Fantastic phone, in a beautiful form factor, handy, ergonomic and power packed device. Please do not go by the reviews of ""PUBG chipmunks"", who are looking for a device for gaming purposes.

6777,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"I have been using iphones for a long time
iPhone 4s - iphone 5s - iphone 6s ,
So when time came to change, I had to chose between iphone11 and iphone SE2020.

Now I chose SE2020 and I am happy with the purchase.

Main reason for choosing SE2020 was the latest CPU and fingerprint scanner.
I am not comfortable with Face ID .

Good product."
6898,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

6911,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.
6912,5,Perfect product!,awesome in ear design. comfortable to wear. high bass. good trumph. budget friendly. I suggest you if you could afford then buy a pouch too for extra protection.‚ù§
6913,5,Must buy!,"This is best handsfree for gaming and listing song. I also play pubg india and other games it's best for all. It has 3D voice system.
So this is best for gaming."
6914,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
6915,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.

6916,5,Perfect product!,best earphones I have ever buy in life soft and clear sound bass is little bit low but it doesn't effect the sound just fabulous
6917,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First of the design is so nice, the texture of the colour is amazing.. Now came to sound quality..I didn't expect it will be this good!! The bass is perfect for ears .. I really feel enjoyed whenever i listen any songs through this headset.. really satisfied for this product... recommend everyone to buy it and enjoy..Thank you."
6918,5,Must buy!,Excellent product it has amazing sound and amazing bass It is better that jbl and boat and value for money
6919,4,Nice product,"Earphone are good quality is nice and overall price to the performance.
Bass is more and this is good for playing games like pubg and more.
Using continuously like listening music(high volume) this sometimes causes earpain."
6920,5,Best in the market!,"realme buds 2 is the best earphones. Perfect for people who like the bass. Sound quality is awesome. Audio is balanced and every instrument is clearly heard.At the price of 500 rupees, it cannot be better than this."
6921,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
6922,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
6923,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
6924,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
6925,5,Terrific purchase,"It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.
One more thing.... The cable organizer helps a lot while keeping the earphone safe and organized while travelling and keeping in jeans pocket.

Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

6928,5,Classy product,The Sound quality is superb and the base quality is also good ..The point thing which I liked in this earphone is that its durability ..the wire quality is good ..before I was using the sennheiser cx275 ..the wire got cut from middle ..I am happy with this earphones.
6929,4,Wonderful,"This earphone is truly worth it's price i.e. 500. Got it 2 days ago and using it since then. Sound quality is awsm and bass too. The only problem I face is with lower notes of music or videos but that is also ok when the price is considered.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
6930,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

6931,4,Value-for-money,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

Feel like sennheiser quality in low price."
6942,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great.

6990,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
6991,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
6992,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking

7015,5,Perfect product!,"Writing this review post 1 month of usage.

Sound quality is good, Bass is also good. Worth the money. The only demerit is the metal plug, sometimes it gets tough to unplug it due to slippery texture. Rest all good. I would recommend to buy this without any hesitation."

7407,1,Worthless,"Phone is awesome no doubt. But Camera & Display is not great. Performance is mind blowing.
But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.
Go for iPhone 11 pro or 12. Otherwise go for Android phone you will get much better phone in less price."
7408,5,Super!,"Did an upgrade from 6s plus to iphone 11.
Ao far the experience is well and good. Felt smoother than 6s plus. The camera quality is superb. Battery backup is descent. Not a heavy user, and gets power more than a day. Go for it if you need an alrounder iphone in a competitve price."
7409,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don‚Äôt think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I‚Äôm posting this review after using it for 4 days."
7410,5,Super!,"This is my first ever iPhone.
And I truly don‚Äôt regret switching to IOS from my Android.

It is easily an alternative to a DSLR camera.
If you‚Äôre obsessed with photos and videos, just don‚Äôt think twice or don‚Äôt compare to other androids(Samsung S10 lite or OnePlus 8/8T), as it‚Äôs far better from them in every field.
Comparing will only make you confused.

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I‚Äôm not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone. That‚Äôs why I made a calculated decision to buy iPhone 11. It has the best LCD display and the blacks, though not as natural as an AMOLED, is better than some of the other smartphones.

7418,5,Wonderful,"Ok, so after almost 3 years I am again back into Apple Ecosystem. Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11. Spending extra 25k just for A14 chipset and OLED display is not a clever choice. Anyways, a fantastic phone with everything fit perfectly..."

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
7460,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
7473,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural.

Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."

Battery backup is quite average only light to medium users can live with it, not meant for heavy users. It can handle each and every task very easily.

7583,5,Super!,"This is good phone for someone who never used iphone yet but of someone using/used any one of iphone 6 , 7 and/or 8 then there is no much difference between the features except performance. With the provided features the price is too high for this phone. If someone is looking for upgrading then I would strongly suggest you to go for iPhone XS or later versions. This is completely my own opinion and please read other reviews as well before making a decision to purchase this product."

P.S.- it's not that small."
7589,5,Terrific,"One of the best handsets, very easy to carry & handle. Exceptional performance & amazing display, however battery is the only concern. It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.

7718,5,Awesome,"Using since May 6th. And it is exceptional. Especially for pubg it's wonderful you can hear the footsteps form where they are coming. There were no problem listing music for long hours. Active noise cancellation is superb you did not hear anything around you when you plug and play.

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
7728,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

7738,3,Nice,"The sound and bass are really good. Bass is really powerful. After 2 weeks of use the pin end is somewhat broken from the inside. Seems wont last for more than 1-2 months at most. But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
7739,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left.

7741,5,Excellent,Realme Buds2 is really gud product with comfort and quality. Satisfied with it. But only issue is small ear plugs are only one pair available in the box which are perfect fit in the ear where extra other plugs are big and not useful.

So this is best for gaming."
7744,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .
7745,4,Delightful,"It's good and excellent for PUBG Gaming but the Base is only experiencenced well when the sound is High ...and if we hear songs at loud Voice then the Base works good but also affects ears.

7751,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
7752,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."

Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
7754,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

7760,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

7812,3,Nice,"Overall moderate quality in-ear headphone.

Pros:
Sweat proof
Tangle free wire
10mm driver for better sound
Good bass level

Cons:
Moderate build quality, colour peeling off from various parts in one month of usage.

Switch controls not so good. Overall quality could be much better as compared to other products from boat in this price range"
7813,5,Wonderful,"Delivered before the delivery date, quality and bass is the best at this price point after using 1 week I m rating this. Worth of purchase.. Makes me happy"

7815,3,Decent product,Nice ear phones with good quality... But it is made in China as written on the box. Braided cable gives you tangle less usage. Strong and long cable is provided and shirt clip with rotate option is available... Over all bass is good... But the vocals are average on the go.

7820,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes . Boat should have provided more ear hooks of different sizes so it could be comfortable for everyone if you have normal or big sized ears , this product will be perfect for you the sound quality is very good, built quality is very good wire length is perfect . This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for me

7842,3,Just okay,Sound quality is good but ear hurts after long usage. It firmly holds its position in ear which quite good for some users but ok for short period of time. Over all sound is good bass is better and wire design is strong.
7843,3,Decent product,"Good design and sound quality (although I am not a fan of bass headphones). I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great. Lots of issues like sound loop, echoes, other person unable to hear loud and clear if the wires are hanging (like in normal cases). If you bring the mic close to the mouth, only then you are properly audible + echoes are there no matter what. So, all in all it is good for those who likes bass headphones, but don't r..."
7844,4,Value-for-money,This review is after 1 month of use. The performance is great worth money but one thing lacks is the build of 2 rubber like support near the earphones it got loosed and streched within a week too poor quality rubber user whereas the wire are little thick and good that's comfortable. The only thing I am not satisfied with the product is the the rubbers near the ear too poor quality rubbers used overall performance is great good for gaming...... One more suggestions don't purchase the lime gre...
7845,4,Nice product,The perfect wired headset at the lowest price. The sound quality is brilliant and it is perfectly fit.

I can definitely garuntee you this product it's been 2 weeks since I bought it and perfect it is
7846,4,Good quality product,Product is Overall Very Good. Excellent Sound Quality And Good Bass. The Only Con. is when it is used for more than 1 hr it is not comfortable to ears. It Causes pain.

7849,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
7850,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
7851,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
7852,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
7853,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
7854,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs.

8211,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures.

8284,1,Worst experience ever!,"Overall performance of the phone is good as expected from Apple, but there is major overheating problem with the phone with minor usage and during charging(even with authentic 20w charger). The phone feels real hot even with minor usage especially on upper left side and left side. During charging, the phone gets very hot(not warm, like literally hot), so i have to plug out the charger after 10 minutes to avoid further heating.

Camera is super awesome in day light and performs pretty well on Night also."
8290,4,Good choice,"I have been a pixel lover and pixel user for so many years. The only reason for shifting to Apple was the ease of content creation on iOS environment.
Google hasn't been launching new pixel devices in India for almost 3 years now and that is really disappointing. My review is based upon the difference between the 2.

Apple lovers may not like my review but even though there is a lot of difference between google and apple, I've still rated the phone as a 4 star product.

8293,5,Awesome,"price range is not for everyone but if you can afford it don't hesitate a bit because this phones gives you most realistic camera, stunning filters, efficient battery life, multimedia files take low storage, applications run smoothly and last but best part is the security features for messaging and payments.

I am not asking everyone to buy it but if you can afford an apple phone then you should always go for it without giving a second thought"
8294,3,Decent product,"Was using the OnePlus 7 pro before this, it was a 2 year old device but still had better battery backup than this Iphone. Rest you all know its an iphone, great camera, nice screen, ios is very smooth and consistent which many android phones lack, Face ID is a pain during Covid and boy they don't give charger which sucks.
Overall a nice phone, battery should have been better"
8295,5,Wonderful,"Upgraded from iPhone X.Noticed 3 major differences instantly.

1. Lot of difference in camera pictures. The best camera model from iPhone so far
2. Light weight and feels very handy during one hand use

Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
8302,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
8303,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
8304,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual.

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)
- Predictable battery life. This means, if your phone is on standby with 2% battery left, you will see the almost same battery percentage even after 2 hours.

8320,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

Guys this phone is Powerhouse with best processor.

I have used phones like poco f1 which had the flagship chips at their time but honestly speaking the performance on this device is just out of the competition!

It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars.

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
8558,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

8580,5,Best in the market!,"realme buds 2 is the best earphones. Perfect for people who like the bass. Sound quality is awesome. Audio is balanced and every instrument is clearly heard.At the price of 500 rupees, it cannot be better than this."
8581,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"i have used jbl ,senheiser , sony mdr ,mi , but really they are all expenisve except mi which is just 399 but comes with great bass and sound quality and sony mdr x50 is superb bass but despite all of them this one real mi i brought 1 month later in 500 and believe me its worth it decent bass bole to 80 out of 100. with superb crystal clear sound i hooe it will help u guys to selct and if u ask for under 500 then mi is good but realme is better"
8582,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."
8583,5,Worth every penny,"Best earphone under 1000
Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
8584,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."
8585,5,Terrific purchase,"It is the best in ear earphone in its price.nice built and noise isolation is good. You can feel every beats of bass.HD crystal clear sound. But the voice clarity could had been improved with the dual drivers. But still the best earphone in this budget. The build quality is also good and it doesn't feel cheap budget earphone.
One more thing.... The cable organizer helps a lot while keeping the earphone safe and organized while travelling and keeping in jeans pocket.

Previously i have used boat 225 which has one of the best bass under 600 & I loved them both the built & sound was superb.

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

Built quality and its functionality were the main I bought these and they stand pretty well in that perspective too. The only thing in its build quality that I hate is that they used 2 wires one is braided and other one is normal. So yeah there's a litt..."
8590,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

8591,4,Value-for-money,"For me the main attraction is the build quality. The main cable is very durable. Although I don't know about the joints. It would've been super if the Y split cables were braided too. Now, the sound quality could've been better. Bass is muddy which overpowers mids and highs. Although because it has a higher volume than other similar earphones the highs are very shrill if you listen to full volume.

Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
8681,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
8682,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"
8683,5,Terrific,"Just Go for it blindly. Best you can get in this price segment. Even better than Realme Buds 2. Yeah, Realme has a better build quality but, this thing sounds betters. In addition, has a one year warranty and IPX4 Rating. Some people say that hooks cause pain in ear, but trust me they fir so well and makes it even more comfortable. I use it 6-7hours continuosly and causes no pain. I have been using a gaming headphone from 2 years. Ofcourse I feel lower stereo than the headphones but the bass ..."
8684,5,Worth every penny,Box Packaging was decent and build quality at this price point is very good. Balance sound and actually i like it because most of the time i listen to old songs. Bass is good not that great but yeah it's ok for me. By the way i am not a bass lover. This headphone really justifies the price. Trust me it's a very good headphone. You r going to love it.
8685,4,Good quality product,"Amazing literally awesome wire quality too good and sound and bass also epic you can surely use it for gaming also and it fits quite better in ears and no pain in my ears after wearing it for 3-4 hours

8688,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It's one of the best earphone at this price range i recommend to go with this if u wanta pure sound quality and bass quality.

8707,5,Highly recommended,It is a nice product but comparing this with basshead 100. In my opinion basshead 100 is better than fitting in ear easily. Not ideal product for using it normally to watch movies. For sports activity it is great

8709,4,Good quality product,"Sound quality is good for the price. I'm a music producer so I know a little bit about sound. Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass. I'm not saying the bass is bad, it is actually really good (the right amount of bass). It is super loud on full volume and at that volume the treble can feel a little too much. So I prefer 1 or 2 down volume for a b..."

9060,5,Classy product,"Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.

P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black"
9061,5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
9062,5,Awesome,Very excited to have this phone. This phone has the real power unlike the android phones having SD 855 . The battery life is very good and the camera quality is excellent as comapred to redmi and other phones except google pixel. I M enjoying every single bit of it.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.

9151,4,Value-for-money,I want to tell u something before I say anything about this iphone I'm not downgrading this iphone I just wasn't surprised enough after using the phone honestly it made me older.... Camera is the best no need to worry about that...the bionic A14 chip is fast no lags or anything screen is good too...ummm everything is fine but if u want to try something new don't go for iphone...that's my opinion...
9152,5,Terrific purchase,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
9153,5,Must buy!,"Overall a good experience. Takes sometime to get used to iOS if you're coming from android. The display is good, looks natural. I turned off true tone as I felt it made the display warmer than I like. Also you might find the colours not very saturated if you're coming from a Samsung phone.
Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."
9154,5,Great product,"Finally moved from Android (OnePlus 7T) to iOS & it‚Äôs a different level. Display is outstanding. Camera superb as usual. But surprised with the battery performance, its really great. Only drawback is the missing of 90Hz display, missed the fluidity of that. May be with time will habituated with that. But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."
9155,5,Simply awesome,"Moved to iPhone from Android since cupcake days and I‚Äôm loving it so far. Brilliant display, camera and performance. IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it‚Äôs very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase."
9156,5,Best in the market!,"Migration from android to iOS, very much exited to use this phone and the quality of the camera is very good, faster and m very happy with the product. Request to send the proper bill along with the product n that is the only concern I have. Thank you."

- Same screen quality compared to 12 Pro. Features are also mostly similar except for a few (for example, three back cameras instead of two), which is not a matter of concern for me.
- Consistent and super-smooth user experience of iOS. (If you are looking for feature richness, better to go with Android)

9180,5,Super!,"My first ios device. Oh boy this is a great device. I am so glad that I made the switch. The only thing I miss is the fast refresh rate of android but it‚Äôs not as bad as it sounds due to fluidity of ios

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

The display is gorgeous. One of the best."

With few latest iOS updates(14.7.1) and few changes in configuration/settings I get a battery life for 2 days per charge(96%). Overall a beast in all segments including the price."
9193,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

Cons: if you are switching from android 5000mah battery and fast charger like 65w then you are going to face a big problem with battery backup , as apple support 20w fast charger so make a note of it ."

9232,1,Unsatisfactory,"Everything is fine of this mobile except battery.

Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness in
Video call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins.
Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins.

For someone coming from a pure Android background, migrating data would take a little time, and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days.

I purchased this product on 6th June,2020 and here is my honest review :

However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

9248,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok.

9402,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars.

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
9428,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

9452,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

9460,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."

Realme released Buds 2 Neo which is 100 cheaper than this but go for Buds 2 instead of Neo and Buds 2 has more premium and sturdy cable.

9500,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
9501,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."

Every single minute detailed sound you can listen on this earphone and for playing PUBG.
9505,4,Delightful,"Compared it with Sennheiser cx180. Bass is smooth in this set but Sennheiser has high treble with boom bass.

Pros:

9520,3,Couuld be perfect,"I have small ears so it doesn""t fits perfectly. So it becomes so uncomfortable for me to use this product for more than 7-8 minutes .

This would be an amazing product for normal sized ears but not for me

I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great.

9549,5,Brilliant,The good product ?????? sound quality is good color is good and the bass boost is awesome ?
9550,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
9551,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
9552,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch
5) Definitely worth for money (489Rs.)"

Audio seperation is easily noticable and better than other earphones in this price range. The sounds produced by boat bassheads 242 is more concentrated towards treble with adequate bass. I'm not saying the bass is bad, it is actually really good (the right amount of bass). It is super loud on full volume and at that volume the treble can feel a little too much.

But the phone is heating too much when charging or when you regularly used. It's experience after using 1 week. It's heating extrem when I play PUBG for 30 minutes.

The only reason why you should buy this phone is for the camera, iOS, and if you have headaches looking at AMOLED display.

I‚Äôm not an avid gamer but watch a lot of movies on smartphone. However, my migraine attacks increased considerably after using AMOLED Smartphone.

Switching from Android to iOS has just one disadvantage imo, and that's you can't take your WhatsApp data restored to iOS. Everything starts fresh, pretty sad. I am so glad that I chose iPhone 11 over 12. With 5G nowhere in India for at least an year will have an added advantage to iPhone 11.

Battery is very good, lasts an entire day and more for me. Camera is also pretty good."

But it‚Äôs worth noting. Overall an awesome luxurious experience from a luxurious brand."

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

Battery life is also good. It would run a day and charges upto 90 percent in an hour.

10073,4,Good choice,"Nice camera nice design ios is extremely fast as expected.

10124,4,Pretty good,"Been using it for almost a year now. I switched to this phone from Samsung galaxy a50 and it was really hard getting used to a 4.7 inch screen from a 6.4 inch one. However, with time i got used to the display and it feels just like any standard display. The display panel is 750p which would look blurry if the screen of this phone was bigger. As it has a smaller screen the pixels are packed close to each other which results in a sharp looking display. Coming to the battery life of this phone, ..."

10128,4,Worth the money,"This is my first iPhone. I would say that coming from Android, there are some times when I feel that it is restricted in certain ways and you just have to accept it.

Coming to the phone itself, camera is amazing minus the low light photography part. Battery backup is ok ok. I bought 12W Apple charger separately which charges it pretty fast so I do not worry about battery being low. Also since I am mostly at home, it doesn‚Äôt matter so much. Display is ok.

P.S.- it's not that small."

It consumes more battery when you use internet, especially streaming videos and also while taking pictures. Otherwise everything thing is perfect.

10282,3,Fair,"Bass is awesome, a little extra, so people who like bass will love this, I personally like a balanced sound signature, so bass can be turned down just a notch, but treble is waaaayyy too high. It really ruins the experience, it hurts my ears. Mids are pretty good. Build quality is decent. Too much treble ruins the sound quality, that's why 3 stars. If treble was balanced then would have given it 4 or even 5 maybe."

Personally i use earphones on daily basis. When i upgraded to these earphones, their design and build quality impressed me. In the first month it became too wet due to rain but still these works the same way as they were on first day.
Good product."
10308,5,Worth every penny,"I bought its because of their build quality, the sound quality is moderate. But they produce too much bass and lite and comfortable as you wear nothing. They are lite and well fitted in my ears with default buds.

To conclude this might be the best pair of earphones you can get under Rs. 600. If your priorities are that the wire lasts long as it's don't get twitch easily.

Don't think too much, just buy it. You will not regret it.

But all the other parts looks better built. I have very rough use and i keep my headset in a pouch. Not worth 600, flipkart smartbuy headphones are better but not much rich in sound like this one."
10319,4,Value-for-money,"Good sound quality, very comfortable, average bass, call quality is a little bit disappointing as the voice is not much clear and sound in right ear is a little bit lower than left.

So this is best for gaming."
10324,4,Good quality product,earphone is very good sound quality is also good but according to me the cable seperater is not given which is required and one more thing that the headphone jack shape is straight which is not comfortable it should be given in L shape for better experience otherwise earphone is awesome I am using this earphone from 46 days which give me a awesome experience I think for this prise range this is well and good .

10332,2,Slightly disappointed,"The sound quality is fine for the price range, but the right side earphone stopped working properly in 3 months usage (lower volume than left side, sometimes, no sound from right side at all).
The mic also would sometimes work but mostly didn't work, after 3 months."

Just go for it
Bass is very good and best for gaming none of the ear phone under 1000 can defeat ."
10334,4,Wonderful,"Sounds gets zzz.... after 80% volume. Bass and sound output is super high. As the main body is made of plastic(not super high quality), built quality and premium feel is not that good compare to mi earphone (700rs). Realme one has better sound cancellation. Mi one is softer and well balanced sound but realme one has 20% over loud sound (bass both similar). Really if u wana buy realme one go for black one."

Now after purchasing realme buds 2 I can say my 600rs was well spent & it has better sound quality than boat 225 hands down the base is punchy & thumping, those 11.2mm drivers are working excellent, probably this is the 225 killer.

10340,5,Great product,"Ok so lemme start from the basics, the Earphones are comfortable, if I'd have to guess then I'd say that it cancels out around 80-90% of the noise around you.

The Pros: this is gonna be mutual traits, the bass on this is CHONKERS and I mean it, they are comfortable to wear, not to mention the magnets on the top of the ear pieces, they are quite clicky too.

Cons: None as of now, I do wanna point out that for some the bass might be a little over the top.

10361,5,Terrific,"First i was hesitate to order this one as before this, i was using boat earphone and satisfied with it, but i google it lot and found this budget friendly high quality earphone and today i got it. I am happy with quality. No distortion of sound at any point. Bass and treble perfect balance. You will really not getting any outer noise after plug-in it in ear. Feel like sennheiser quality in low price."
10362,5,Terrific,"Great product value for money. But bass is not up to my expectations, i feel little low bass as compare to treble. High quality vocals(crisp and clear), and treble. Mic is good but not HD.( If little more bass with same or more clear bass quality, will make it more awesome product). For bass lover little tip is here, use equaliser with this to boost bass, it will works for you, you can go for it."
10363,5,Just wow!,"Writing this review after a year of using this

Realme released Buds 2 Neo which is 100 cheaper than this but go for Buds 2 instead of Neo and Buds 2 has more premium and sturdy cable.

I tried different types of wired earphones in the past under 1k price range including boat, sony, jbl etc but none of them lasted more than 6 months for my usage, but the best budget earphones for me is Redmi Basic which is under 399 but they are not available since 1 year so I had to buy Realme buds 2 which ..."

10380,4,Worth the money,"Sound quality is good when you are a music lover.. but not very good for phone calls as it produces lot of bass, which reduces the voice clarity. but it's awesome for bass music."
10381,5,Awesome,"This is a good product, no doubt and I have been using it for a month now. Cheap, yet sturdy with good audio. At higher volumes, it does fuzz out a little. The ""s"" gets very scratchy. But at low to normal volume, it is great. It comes with a total of 3 ear plugs - small, medium, large. The best part is the clip. It is extremely helpful if you are moving about as you talk. Good product, fast delivery by Flipkart, it arrived 2 days before time. Would recommend for sure."
10382,1,Absolute rubbish! VERY BAD for CALLING,"If you buying this earphone for CALLING don't buy this. I received earphone and i try this. For calling it creating extra distortion in voice.

I purchased it mainly to take business calls while working, but in that respect it is not at all great.

10430,5,Great product,"I felt, the sound quality is same as Bassheads 162. The quality of the wire is not as great as expect as it was in Bassheads 162. But looks are better.
It has a thick wire. A bit of additional plastic type coating all over. In the image, it looks like there is a texture over the wire, but it's not.

Right hook does not fit properly. But it is removable. Good bass and treble."
10431,4,Pretty good,"Compared to mi in ear basic, it's little uncomfortable to keep in ear at first for me because of the build I think. If I don't wear it for some days, it feels uncomfortable at first once again. If you've sensitive skin, it might hurt if you keep it in ear for long. Other than this it's very good product in this range, when it comes to sound quality & buttons. The mic also works very well even I don't hold it while on call or on record. The wire is also good quality & doesn't get tangled easily."
10432,4,Worth for 489 and seems to be good in build quality,"yesterday I received this item. Too early to rate this, However on first look and Testing it:

1) Good looking
2) Build quality seems to be good as it seems the wires are concealed in silica which may prevent the wires from damage (but have to wait and see over time)
3) Sound quality is good.
4) Comes with clip to pin the wires with shirt and a good cloth pouch

10578,2,Expected a better product,These earphones are pretty basic yet they fail to provide the bare minimum one expects from budget oriented earphones. Boat is known for its bass and sturdy built quality and both were missing in this model. The wire length of the earphones are small and doesn't provide the extra freedom to move whem plugged in. BOTTOM LINE put few more bucks and go for basshead 225 or 220 or if you are short on cash Flipkart smart buy basic earphones are still better than this one.
10579,1,Utterly Disappointed,"Am using MI earphones which is available almost for the same price. I used them upto two years, they were still performing well, base and voice quality. But I lost them, so I thought to order them again, but watching all the reviews I bought this earphones. These earphones are very disappointing. There is no proper lock-in , and during calls you can't hear other people's voice clearly, and they are too much loud, unbearable to ears, even if we adjusted low volume in our mobile.

10649,5,Worth every penny,This gives everything u need perfect sound quality even in High volume.. bass is topnotch and build quality is Outstanding at this price range.. You can buy this without any hesitation..‚ù§üëå
10650,4,Wonderful,Actually pretty good.... The sound and built quality are very good... The body is sturdy and capable of with standing stepping over.... The design may not be very flashy but is a little bit stylish.. You can select it if you are going for an upgrade from thr boat bassheads 100 or any other similar headphones
10651,3,Decent product,Looks and sounds good. Under 349 it's a value for money product. Love it. Itcan much better but yeah its a good product.
10652,5,Brilliant,"Awesome product by boat good design good sound quality , Highly recommend üôÉ"
10653,5,Awesome,"Awesome product
Sound quality is very good
Not as good as mi earphones but very good
In discription it says sweat proof but
I accidentally drop this in washing Machine üòÇ
It was in machine for at least 2 hr but still there was no problem found in headset
So u can say that it is waterproof
Highly recommended
Value for money"
10654,5,Wonderful,Perfect bass and sound quality for me. Before this earphone I used to use JBL. To be honest I didn't regard at all after purchase this BoAt product. 4.5 out of 5 for me.
10655,4,Worth the money,"I have used it about 5 months ...and I m sharing my experience
Pros:
1. Sound quality is nice at this price
2. I m using it from 5 months and it is working good as same as before .
3. Classy look.
4. Magnet is present at the back side of buds

Cons.
1. Bass is ok ..not much good
If you are looking for a good bass earphone go for another one..or model 242 has very good bass
2. For listening music and watching movies it is good but for calling its Jack disturb many times..not good for calling ."
10656,5,Terrific,Very nice headphone üòõ sound quality very nice and bass awesome üòõ design is very nice
10657,4,Very Good,This headphones is comfortable fitting and sound was good bass üëå nice product nice sound comfort design...
10658,4,Nice product,Good sound quality but should be more good if you want to buy good product in low budget then you can go for it
10659,5,Must buy!,nice earphones with good sound quality and good bass..... really loved it...
10660,5,Just wow!,"Very light weight earphones, sounds good enough for the price.
The build quality is not the best but what else can you expect at this price range, you can't pay for a Fiat & expect to get a Ferrari, so I'm satisfied with this."
10661,4,Pretty good,Sound is awesome just because of high bass sound become quite sharp from my point of view boat bass head100 was better in sound as well as in design too
10662,5,Simply awesome,"the sound quality and the bass is really good, the clarity of sound is as comparable with the apple earpods that comes with the iPhone, I was in dire need for such an earphone that sounded just like apple earpods but also shouldn't be heavy on my pocket.
inshort great sound quality, good design and bang for the buck. go for it."
10663,4,Nice product,"Value for money.
Below 399, I believe this is really a good one.
Sound quality is nice but please don't expect it to be a Sennheiser one.
Bass is okay if you increase the volume or bass settings in your device, you can have the effect but it is very average quality.
Build is good

Lastly I want to thank Flipkart for the packaging and defect free device."
10664,4,Good choice,"This product is very good interms of sound, bass, comfort in this price range (Rs 399). After using this product I ordered another for my friend. I strongly recommend to go for this product without any doubts."
10665,4,Wonderful,One of the excellent product for 375 rupees. For this price everything good but sound quality is little bit low when compare of boat 225 price of boat 225 is 450. Otherwise bass and product quality and trendy colour everything is good. I am satisfied from this product.
10666,5,Super!,"Nice headset, totally satisfied with the design, color and quality of material.
Would recommend others to try and enjoy the music.
I purchased this after searching and comparing many headset available in market and after getting the best price, ordered the same at INR 399.00 only."
10667,5,Wonderful,Best earphone go for it guys...just loved it perfect sound perfect bass..best for pubg players.

91,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
92,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

202,5,Brilliant,The best cheapest AMOLED phone available in indian market. Everything good but compared to MIUI Samsung UI is not that great. Rest Hardware wise all good. Better than Realme and Redmi devices
203,5,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.
204,4,Very Good,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/ 5
Overall this device is value for money üí∞..
Camera is good as compared to other brand (realme, mi, vivo) at this price range .
Battery is massive.
Display is good , this is HD amoled screen which give you true colour in screen as compared to other brand.
6.4 inch screen is perfect for me..
Build quality is very good"
205,4,Really Nice,Good phone... Nice camera... Great battery life .. almost 44 gb of free space is available after pre-installed apps(for 64 gb model)
206,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Samsung delivered a phone at his best for this price.
Camera is good as per the cost and you can not expect more
SAMOLED very good display
Notifications are up to the current trend
Batter is good since 6000 mah power
I don't want to go for china product so I always go for non-china makers
Go for it!"

210,2,Slightly disappointed,"Everything in this mobile is pretty good and android is lovely. A very bad experience from samsung. Network problem is really unacceptable. In the area where network is very high in this area it is saying out of network coverage area. At all, not happy with the performance of the mobile. I was very excited bcoz this was my 1st ever samsung mobile till now."

6. Sim Network reception - 4/5 (No 4G+ Support)
7. External speaker quality- 3.5/5
8. No lag or freezing issue
9. Battery Charging time @ 2 hours and 30 min.
10. Battery Discharge time @ 1.5 Day (For moderate user)
10. All sensors are work Perfectly
11. Super amoled Display with 90 Hz Refresh rate great combination"
212,5,Just wow!,"Value for money good mobile in this range buy it.

But Samsung service centers should be improved in terms of service.

Else flip kart is best in services as well as in products,some items are too high price else overall good."

214,3,Good,"Pros:
Excellent battery life

Not much heating issues
Satisfactory rear cams
Call quality is acceptable most of the time
Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.
I doubt the so called KNOX is actually working in it or not.

217,4,Worth the money,"Batteryüîã backup is pretty good, though fast changing isn't actually fast enough to charge this 6000 mah battery. Camera could have been far better for this 48 MP lense.

218,5,Terrific,"Very nice phone, has awesome camera quality.
I m totally impressed. Battery backup is great.
But it comes with many inbuilt apps, so it occupies around 10GB of storage..
Overall nice mobile at this price range üëç"
219,4,Worth the money,Using this phone for past 3months. No issues..camera is quite good. Macro photographers won't be disappointed. No heating issue. Charging takes around 2hrs. Display is quite crisp with bice viewing angles. Brightness is bit on lower side. Over all a trusted brand which provides good speed..ram ..everything. fully satisfied.
220,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

224,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
225,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones üéß as it has dolby atmos feature."

233,5,Best in the market!,"This mobile is very good. Camera and and battery quality very good performance of this phone is very good overall very good phone at cheapest price.
I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
234,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
235,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .
Hope my review will be helpful üôèüèª‚ú®: )"

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

So don't think too much and if your budget is Under 12 k you can go for this because it's the best phone under this price range."

Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."

581,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
582,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

700,2,Slightly disappointed,"Everything in this mobile is pretty good and android is lovely. A very bad experience from samsung. Network problem is really unacceptable. In the area where network is very high in this area it is saying out of network coverage area. At all, not happy with the performance of the mobile. I was very excited bcoz this was my 1st ever samsung mobile till now."

6. Sim Network reception - 4/5 (No 4G+ Support)
7. External speaker quality- 3.5/5
8. No lag or freezing issue
9. Battery Charging time @ 2 hours and 30 min.
10. Battery Discharge time @ 1.5 Day (For moderate user)
10. All sensors are work Perfectly
11. Super amoled Display with 90 Hz Refresh rate great combination"
702,5,Just wow!,"Value for money good mobile in this range buy it.

But Samsung service centers should be improved in terms of service.

Else flip kart is best in services as well as in products,some items are too high price else overall good."
703,5,Classy product,"Samsung F22 fabulous budget Phone
1-battery performance great

704,3,Good,"Pros:
Excellent battery life
Display has punchy and pleasing colours
Not much heating issues
Satisfactory rear cams
Call quality is acceptable most of the time
Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.
I doubt the so called KNOX is actually working in it or not.

707,4,Worth the money,"Batteryüîã backup is pretty good, though fast changing isn't actually fast enough to charge this 6000 mah battery. Camera could have been far better for this 48 MP lense.

708,5,Terrific,"Very nice phone, has awesome camera quality.

710,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

714,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
715,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming.

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
724,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
725,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

971,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
972,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.
I doubt the so called KNOX is actually working in it or not.

1097,4,Worth the money,"Batteryüîã backup is pretty good, though fast changing isn't actually fast enough to charge this 6000 mah battery. Camera could have been far better for this 48 MP lense. Phone performance is pretty good. Front camera üì∑ is only average. Can opt this out if battery life and display quality only matters for some standard budget branded phone."
1098,5,Terrific,"Very nice phone, has awesome camera quality.
I m totally impressed. Battery backup is great.
But it comes with many inbuilt apps, so it occupies around 10GB of storage..
Overall nice mobile at this price range üëç"
1099,4,Worth the money,Using this phone for past 3months. No issues..camera is quite good. Macro photographers won't be disappointed. No heating issue. Charging takes around 2hrs. Display is quite crisp with bice viewing angles. Brightness is bit on lower side. Over all a trusted brand which provides good speed..ram ..everything. fully satisfied.
1100,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

1104,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
1105,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones üéß as it has dolby atmos feature."

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
1114,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
1115,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

1370,5,This game is fun,"It's fun even with only two people playing. This game can go on for hours. It all depends on how long you want to keep score.

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

1400,5,Excellent,"One of the best ways to have fun on off days, or with the intent to relax. Playing UNO does not take a lot of (mental) effort, unlike the more traditional Card games. The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules. So with a brief, 5 minute introduction, even a newbie will be ready for a game. Albeit it takes some time to master and figure out the techniques.

1471,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
1472,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."

2051,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
2052,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

2750,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
2751,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
2752,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

Batter is good performance

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."

3531,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
3532,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones üéß as it has dolby atmos feature."
3656,5,Perfect product!,Amazing phone in budget only only problem If Get Helio 88 with 500 hundreds no problem than this become also good time pass Gamer phone people like it so much otherwise it is still good phone for time pass Gamer smooth with ultra run well not much legs but yes some Samsung did better work this time others Samsung phone out of budgets if we see at their prices
3657,4,Delightful,"Overall smartphone is good
Camera battery performance are good
Ui can be improved and alot of useless app are pre-installed which is not required
Charging take above 2 hours with the provided 15w charger
If they provided 20w or more it's will be the best for 6000mah"

3662,5,Wonderful,Good phone and you loved it if you use it in daily life. It is complete overall balance phone and i am using it right now around 15 days and i believed it will run long due to it's overall balance performance.
3663,5,Best in the market!,"This mobile is very good. Camera and and battery quality very good performance of this phone is very good overall very good phone at cheapest price.
I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
3664,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
3665,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

3668,5,Terrific,"If you are planning on to buy a budget smartphone this can be one !! Though the display could be better .
But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .
Hope my review will be helpful üôèüèª‚ú®: )"
3669,4,Pretty good,A best phone to buy. True samsung quality. Must buy. Speed was good and all features was awesome . But sound is very very poor. Sound -1/5.

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

So don't think too much and if your budget is Under 12 k you can go for this because it's the best phone under this price range."

3920,5,This game is fun,"It's fun even with only two people playing. This game can go on for hours. It all depends on how long you want to keep score.

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

3950,5,Excellent,"One of the best ways to have fun on off days, or with the intent to relax. Playing UNO does not take a lot of (mental) effort, unlike the more traditional Card games. The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules. So with a brief, 5 minute introduction, even a newbie will be ready for a game. Albeit it takes some time to master and figure out the techniques.

The quality of the cards is impeccable, thereby co..."

4421,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
4422,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

4554,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
4555,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.

5401,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
5402,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

5540,5,Must buy!,Good to go with F22.working fine without any issue..purchase for camera..and it's camera quality is too good in this price range compare to other phone. Bettery is also good...
5541,4,Really Nice,"Good product
Display is very nice .the battery also good 6000mh overall good ."
5542,5,Wonderful,Good phone and you loved it if you use it in daily life. It is complete overall balance phone and i am using it right now around 15 days and i believed it will run long due to it's overall balance performance.
5543,5,Best in the market!,"This mobile is very good. Camera and and battery quality very good performance of this phone is very good overall very good phone at cheapest price.
I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
5544,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
5545,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."
5546,4,Wonderful,"Good display, battery good, camera ok for price. but if u r claiming as 48 mp then came should be good. Flipkart packing should improve no bubble wrap? Overall good buy."

5548,5,Terrific,"If you are planning on to buy a budget smartphone this can be one !! Though the display could be better .
But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .
Hope my review will be helpful üôèüèª‚ú®: )"

5790,5,This game is fun,"It's fun even with only two people playing. This game can go on for hours. It all depends on how long you want to keep score.

There are so many ways to throw wrenches into this game, and that is what makes it interesting. One minute you can be down to one card, - hence the name of the game - and the next be caught with tons of cards and have to give all those points away. All because someone changed the color, or threw down an action card.

Gotta love the action cards that can mess up your g..."

5820,5,Excellent,"One of the best ways to have fun on off days, or with the intent to relax. Playing UNO does not take a lot of (mental) effort, unlike the more traditional Card games. The best thing about it is that the rules are flexible (depending on who plays it and where) because of the concept of house rules. So with a brief, 5 minute introduction, even a newbie will be ready for a game. Albeit it takes some time to master and figure out the techniques.

6490,4,Nice product,Very Nice phone it's charging time is to fast i really impressed with phone but camera was a good how i am think
6491,3,Fair,Look and buildwise phone is awesome but the main selling point was their 50MP camera which isn‚Äôt true. It does feel like 2 MP camera. Rest everything is good at this price point. Camera lovers don‚Äôt go for it
6492,4,Nice product,Phone is good at this price point. 90hz Display is good enough. Dual speaker offers good sound. Charging is pretty fast. Only 50mp sensor is good and the other two 2mp sensors are not useful. They could have provided an ultra wide or telephoto sensor insted of these two 2mp sensors. Also disappointed with Android 11 out of the box. It would be nice if it was Android 12. Overall not much to complain considering the price. Good phone .

6592,5,Brilliant,The best cheapest AMOLED phone available in indian market. Everything good but compared to MIUI Samsung UI is not that great. Rest Hardware wise all good. Better than Realme and Redmi devices
6593,5,Worth every penny,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.
6594,4,Very Good,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/ 5

Camera is good as compared to other brand (realme, mi, vivo) at this price range .
Battery is massive.

Build quality is very good"

6600,2,Slightly disappointed,"Everything in this mobile is pretty good and android is lovely. A very bad experience from samsung. Network problem is really unacceptable. In the area where network is very high in this area it is saying out of network coverage area. At all, not happy with the performance of the mobile. I was very excited bcoz this was my 1st ever samsung mobile till now."

Cons:I bet it's not a true HD display.
My 4 year old J7 NXT has way better sharpness
than this phone.
No carrier aggregation.So 4G speeds are limited in both SIMs.
Sad thing is that MTek Helio G80 supports CA but Samsung purposefully omitted the same.
Spammy notifications.

6608,5,Terrific,"Very nice phone, has awesome camera quality.
I m totally impressed. Battery backup is great.

Display is quite crisp with bice viewing angles. Brightness is bit on lower side. Over all a trusted brand which provides good speed..ram ..everything. fully satisfied.
6610,2,Moderate,"One buys samsung mobile for blotware free experience but I have to say that my experience with samsung is ruined.

Samsung should stop blotware installation through galaxy app. It's very annoying that without your permission galaxy app installs so many blotwares even you uninstall it.

It's camera previews photo in filter/artificial/enhanced mode but when you click the photo and see it photo comes close to natural mode. It's like showing enhanced photo in preview mode convert it into natural...."

6614,3,Nice,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.
6615,5,Terrific purchase,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones üéß as it has dolby atmos feature."

I like this mobile phone. Video quality very good. You can purchase this mobile."
6624,4,Good choice,"Ordered Samsung F12 for my mother back in June. My wife wanted a same phone but we ended up buying F22 this time. I must say I wasn't expecting this. Display is far better than F12. Camera is substantially better & phone is smaller & lighter compared to F12. It you are in this price range, buy this without a thought rather than Chinese owned brands who might take away your privacy & security by giving you gimmicky 100MP cameras & what not."
6625,5,Brilliant,"Today I have received the phone through wishmaster. As I see that in this budget I really got a great phone. Samsung is the king of Androids.
Phone is very smooth to operate. I don't play games so no comments on that but for my use like official or personal use it is the best phone ever.

Thank you Flipkart for delivery the pproduct on time."

But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .

I got this phone at 10749, with axis bank card, flipkart delivered this order within 2 days. The design of this phone is really eye catching and display is so smooth, about the performance, if you are not a heavy gamer this is perfect smartphone for you. One of the best thing in this phone that is UI of this phone.

I loved it!!üòç"
2,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

3,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."

1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.

13,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
14,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...

102,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

103,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
104,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."

108,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
109,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
110,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
111,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
112,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.

It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me).

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

571,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!üòç"
572,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
573,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
574,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
575,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! üòçüëç"
576,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
577,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
578,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
579,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
580,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
581,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
582,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
583,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
584,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

674,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

961,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!üòç"
962,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
963,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
964,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
965,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! üòçüëç"
966,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
967,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
968,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
969,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
970,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
971,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
972,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
973,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
974,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

1054,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

1157,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

1442,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

1443,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
1444,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."

1446,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
1447,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
1448,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
1449,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
1450,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
1451,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
1452,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
1453,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
1454,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
1637,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.
1638,4,Worth the money,Trust product and storage nearly 28.8GB
1639,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

I prefer it's best one."
1641,4,Awesome,The product is good for daily usage. If u are one who needs to write and delete a huge amount of data everyday then go for a usb 3.0 its average writing speed is 6-8mbps and read speed is 72 mbps(as per my observation) well using it for a year and no issues at all......hit like if u liked the review..

1645,5,Great product,"I Love the product very nice and good working,
I didn't think the storage in 32gb pendrive of 31full gb so nice"
1646,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
1647,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

1931,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!üòç"
1932,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps

1933,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
1934,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
1935,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! üòçüëç"
1936,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
1937,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
1938,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
1939,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
1940,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
1941,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
1942,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
1943,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
1944,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

2137,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

USB Flash Drive is so good This product is value for money and id high speed data Transfer support and Flipkart give 5 Year warranty for any issues all costumer plz buy this product and carry your Documents . i love Flipkart"
2431,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!üòç"
2432,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
2433,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
2434,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
2435,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! üòçüëç"
2436,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
2437,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
2438,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
2439,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
2440,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
2441,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
2442,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
2443,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
2444,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
2627,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.

2629,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

2637,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

3011,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!üòç"
3012,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
3013,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
3014,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
3015,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! üòçüëç"
3016,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
3017,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
3018,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
3019,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
3020,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
3021,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
3022,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
3023,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
3024,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

You should go for usb 3.0 for better performance especially in 2021."
3210,5,Terrific purchase,"It's awsome. Nothing to say. 1st buy it then you decide by own if it is good or bad.

I prefer it's best one."
3211,4,Awesome,The product is good for daily usage. If u are one who needs to write and delete a huge amount of data everyday then go for a usb 3.0 its average writing speed is 6-8mbps and read speed is 72 mbps(as per my observation) well using it for a year and no issues at all......hit like if u liked the review..

3216,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
3217,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

3623,5,Wonderful,Nice deal to get on. I got it around 334 using supercoins. Earlier I was using mi basic earphones. Compared to those this this tge same with bass and a extra addon of treble which is balanced very nicely. You can hear the crisp sounds as well by setting eqalizer. I had also used leaf wireless earphones which was nice. I believe no earphones lasts more than 8 months. So ultimately u have to change it. So I tried this cheap ones but they are really good. You can go for it.

3711,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!üòç"
3712,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
3713,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
3714,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
3715,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! üòçüëç"
3716,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
3717,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
3718,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
3719,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
3720,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
3721,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
3722,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
3723,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
3724,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
3907,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.

3909,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:

4303,5,Wonderful,Nice deal to get on. I got it around 334 using supercoins. Earlier I was using mi basic earphones. Compared to those this this tge same with bass and a extra addon of treble which is balanced very nicely. You can hear the crisp sounds as well by setting eqalizer. I had also used leaf wireless earphones which was nice. I believe no earphones lasts more than 8 months. So ultimately u have to change it. So I tried this cheap ones but they are really good. You can go for it.

4393,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
4394,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."

4426,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It is the best tws in this price range. Ergonomic design is absolutely perfect, it doesn't fall even while riding a bike. Touch controls are also smooth. On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

4435,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"

Value for money"
4480,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
4481,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
4482,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
4483,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
4484,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

4666,5,Simply awesome,"Amazing Pendrive, I ordered 32 GB but received 64GB.
So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
4667,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.
4668,4,Worth the money,Trust product and storage nearly 28.8GB
4669,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

I prefer it's best one."
4671,4,Awesome,The product is good for daily usage. If u are one who needs to write and delete a huge amount of data everyday then go for a usb 3.0 its average writing speed is 6-8mbps and read speed is 72 mbps(as per my observation) well using it for a year and no issues at all......hit like if u liked the review..

4675,5,Great product,"I Love the product very nice and good working,
I didn't think the storage in 32gb pendrive of 31full gb so nice"
4676,5,Terrific purchase,Awesome product... Nice looks.... Awesome performance... I like it.. I recommend to everyone
4677,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

Flipkart don't recommend and support this type of product"
5128,5,Brilliant,Awsome earphone for music and for playing games like pubg. This earphone has excellent bass on this price point and best in this price segment. This earphone also comes with excellent grip and nice audio quality. I should recommend this for gaming.
5129,4,Pretty good,The head phones ar too good the sound the bass is beyond expected .... I never thought that this headphones wil be so good in this affordable price
5130,4,Very Good,Bass is bit muddy but you can feel the beat on it. Sound separation i.e instruments separation is not great . Vocal are clear but at high volume it kighy be uncomfortable. Sound doesnt feel that it is in the center in your head it always in the periferi and its not good thing while enjoying music.
5131,5,Brilliant,Best earphone and one of trusted company which has good customer care support .after 5 months my earphones not working well then company exchange with new one .

5173,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
5174,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."

5196,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It is the best tws in this price range. Ergonomic design is absolutely perfect, it doesn't fall even while riding a bike. Touch controls are also smooth. On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

5205,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"

5360,5,Just wow!,"Excellent product üëàüëàüëà
USB Flash Drive is so good This product is value for money and id high speed data Transfer support and Flipkart give 5 Year warranty for any issues all costumer plz buy this product and carry your Documents . i love Flipkart"
5361,4,Nice product,"nice product it's so durable that you drop it by 4th floor of building nothing gonna happen to it, very handy
I loved it!!üòç"
5362,4,@ Offered Price its Worth it,"This Pen Drive offers you storage of 29.9 almost 30gb , with Good Transfer rate if you're transferring more than 4gb you can have a cup of coffee and make a call , so data rate is little slow not much to spoil your mood , its not like those offered at 2K with a lightning speed ! i was satisfied as i am a coffee lover too... just kidding !

Build - : its always good coz its Sandisk
Transfer rate : Could have been Better but still Good ! Almost 18-25 mbps
Looks : 5/10 ( Its ..."
5363,5,Great product,"It's a 32GB USB 2.0 pen drive from SanDisk, it's not as fast as USB 3.0 pen drives (The maximum write speed I personally got was about 87mbps, but your mileage may vary), but you're getting a generous amount of storage for the price. It works pretty well for my specific use case (taking local backups, I'll never use it more than 2-3 times a year, so speed doesn't matter to me). If you're looking for something with blazing fast read and write speeds, spend a little more and get yourself a USB ..."
5364,4,Really Nice,"This pen drive is good than HP pen drive, but it shows only 28.6 GB out of 32GB. Data transfer rate is good as compared with HP. Flipcart gives 5 years warranty for any issues. So you may buy this product without any, confusing. I ordered another one for my wife and son. Thanks Flipcart for sending genuine product."
5365,5,Awesome,"|||| 29.24 GB/32 GB |||| What amazing products & value for money & transfers speed is amazing because it is a great & original product
so vvvvvv thnx to flipkart! üòçüëç"
5366,5,Just wow!,SanDisk is best brand in pen drive & SD card. fast data transfer. OTG is best for mobile.
5367,5,Best in the market!,Very good quality
5368,4,"Good Product, Worth Buying","The product is very good if you don't need to upload many files at a time, suppose 8 GB
at one go. Its slow, but worth the price. And its light compared to many other drives. The looks are also pretty good, and sleek too."
5369,5,Brilliant,Well it's great and uh i loved it.I bought this to make a bootable USB.It's work like a charm
5370,4,Good 32 GB Pen Drive,"Pros :
1) Good 32 GB Pen Drive. 4/5 Rating for product.
2) Design could be better as it doesn't have a cap to cover the USB jack/port area.
3) It's too light weight - prone to falling out of the hand easily/pocket. Being made of very light plastic it doesn't make much of a sound when it falls. So you could easily lose it falling from pocket/table.
4) The plastic looks flimsy - like it could break without much stress.
For Rs. 1061 I'd expect better quality of plastic at least.

Cons : 2/5 ..."
5371,4,BEST DEVICE WORTH BUYING,"Good writing speed 4 to 6 mbps and copying speed from the usb is 19 to 21 mbps.So overall its a nice product to add to ur cart. Its also good for those who want to carry alot of movies to a small device. Good for those who play video games so u can copy games 20 to 30 gb.
i prefer this device for those who are fond of lots of movies,games songs and other data to carry in one device.
nice product must buy"
5372,5,Value for money.,Stop worrying about it.. an awesome product from flipkart at good price. Easily supports laptops and By using OTG connector easily supports Android devices. Copying speed is Good.
5373,4,Pretty good,"I'm using this pen drive since a year. And I can blindly say that, this is the best pen drive ever. Delivery is super fast,the transfer speed is fabulous, no deletion or corruption of data as seen in other pen drives.highest speed you can get for data transfers(copy/paste/move) depends on your device.,also easy to carry and With the ultra-compact and portable SanDisk Cruzer Blade USB flash Drive, you can take your files with you wherever you go."
5374,3,Not that Good,"I recently bought this item(Sandisk Cruzer Blade 32 GB Pen Drive , USB 2.0) from 'WS Retail' seller & I must say, it's NOT one of the best Pen Drive in my experience(not including USB 3.0)... Though cheap item,only Rs.749... Formatted in NTFS format & got 29 GB free space...
Write speed : avg 5 MB/s (slow IMO)...
Read speed : avg 19 MB/s...
So, I'd say it's not the first choice for me...
I'd suggest not to get this PD if u r looking for a 2.0 PD...
Got this item in 5 business days... Thank Yo..."

5454,4,Good quality product,"As far as the basic functionality of a pen drive is concerned, it performs well. Just like a pen drive of any company in the market would perform. I own 3-4 pen drives all 2.0s of different brands hp, Kingston, and SanDisk. Didn't find much difference between the read/write speed.

Coming to the looks, it definitely stands from the crowd of red/black plastic body or even any other metal pen drive. In a few words, Minimalistic Classic design. Feels sturdy."

So I am so happy. Hope same happen it with you."
5547,4,Nice product,Absolutely nice product but the only disadvantage is it is made up of silver amd hence everytime you touch it your fingertips are printed on it. The USB PROTOCOL is 2.0 but still it's faster the San disk cruzer blade.

5549,3,Just okay,"Pendrive is good but get heated a little bit. Speed is not much, just 6-7 mbps. Because it is usb 2.0

5557,4,Good choice,"It's Been a year or so for me with this one.....Firstly Let's Talk about it's pros:
*Copying speed is satisfactory
*Agronomical Design for opening
*Carry whole is present
Now it's time for cons:
*Does'nt have inbuilt Recycler
*If u r a Very Rough user then u may damage it's inner components
At last considering the price point I have rated it 4/5...it will go with with daily use...but if u want faster speeds then go for the nitros ones"

Compared to those this this tge same with bass and a extra addon of treble which is balanced very nicely. You can hear the crisp sounds as well by setting eqalizer. I had also used leaf wireless earphones which was nice. I believe no earphones lasts more than 8 months. So ultimately u have to change it. So I tried this cheap ones but they are really good. You can go for it.

6053,5,Super!,This XPODS case has a glossy finished look with light weight. It takes 1hour to fully charge the case as well as the earbuds. The earbuds design is some what like apple but it gives pain as I am not used to this type of models. It gives nice bass for the songs and gives backup up to 18hours as I used it in medium volume I observed Up to 22 hours backup.it is easy to pair as I am not aware of the touch control model it took some time to get used to it. This model is perfect for calls only ...
6054,5,Wonderful,"Bought these in flipkart big billion days sale at a very healthy discount. After early use of the product, I can say that these are really good earbuds in value for money prospect. Bass is the best thing about these because it's really really good. You have to compromise with noise cancellation in this price range. Battery backup is also good of about 14-15 hours in regular use. At the end, undoubtedly go for it in this budget."

And if you are taking for listening only then you can purchase something more better than this. But nevertheless they are also good in volume and bass. It‚Äôs and average product in listening and best in design. And battery backup is too good."

GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY DOUBTS IN THIS PRICE RANGE....üëè"
6086,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"It is the best tws in this price range. Ergonomic design is absolutely perfect, it doesn't fall even while riding a bike. Touch controls are also smooth. On a one charge, you can rely on it for 2 and half days, without any doubt (including the charging of case). Seamless connectivity with any device. Sound quality and bass is a bit compromising, but according to the price of the product, we can't question it. So go for it. For me, the best part is that it doesn't hurt my ears even on long use."

6095,4,Wonderful,"Boult Xpods are an amazing gift for any music lover stuck in a tight budget. Been using it for two days now, while the music quality has been above my expectations, the touch based user interface is something not everyone will be able to master. I don't know if it's just me but, I think the touch sensors could've been more receptive. But this can be overcome voice in command feature that kicks in the moment you say 'hey google' or 'hey siri'"
